By using our easy to use <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/features\/drag-drop-online-form-builder\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">drag and drop online form builder<\/a>, you can easily add custom form fields, rearrange them, and basically create a complete contact form in 5 minutes or less.<\/p>\n<p>But don&#8217;t just take our word. See what one of the WordPress experts are saying:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>WPForms is by far the <strong>easiest form plugin to use<\/strong>. My clients love WPForms and it&#8217;s one of the few plugins they can use without any training. As a developer I appreciate how fast, modern, clean and extensible it is.<br \/>\n  Bill Erickson &#8211; Expert WordPress Consultant<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h4>Pre-built Form Templates<\/h4>\n<p>Building contact forms in WordPress can be time consuming. Why?<\/p>\n<p>Because every other WordPress contact form builder plugin requires you to build your contact form from scratch. The truth is it&#8217;s often not necessary to create a contact form completely from scratch unless you really want to.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you&#8217;re looking to create a simple contact form, marketing form, request a quote form, donation form, payment order form, registration form, or a subscription form, we have a form template for you inside our contact form builder.<\/p>\n<p>WPForms comes with <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/features\/form-templates\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">pre-built form templates<\/a> to help you save time. You can add, remove, or re-arrange fields as necessary.<\/p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/demo\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">150+ Pre-Made WPForms Form Template Demo<\/a><\/p>\n<h4>Mobile Ready, SEO Friendly and Optimized for Speed<\/h4>\n<p>WPForms&#8217; contact forms are 100% responsive and mobile-friendly by default. We also optimized every query on the front-end and the back-end to ensure maximum speed &#8211; Yes, WPForms is one of the fastest WordPress contact form plugin.<\/p>\n<p>You can embed your contact form on any page with optimized title and description. With the speed and proper formatting, WPForms is also one of the most SEO friendly contact form plugin.<\/p>\n<h4>All the Fields &amp; Features that You Need to Succeed<\/h4>\n<p>From star ratings to file uploads to multi-page contact forms with progress bar, we have all the fields you need.<\/p>\n<p>You can easily integrate your contact forms with an email marketing service or collect payments for bookings and orders. WPForms allows you to do it all.<\/p>\n<p>The best part is, you can do it all without hiring a developer.<\/p>\n<p>See what one business owner has to say about WPForms&#8217; contact form:<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As a business owner, time is my most valuable asset. WPForms allow me to create smart contact forms with just a few clicks. With their pre-built form templates and the drag &amp; drop builder, I can create a new form that works in less than 2 minutes without writing a single line of code. Well worth the investment.<br \/>\n  David Henzel &#8211; Co-founder of MaxCDN<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h4>Surveys &amp; Polls<\/h4>\n<p>Along with contact form, you can also use WPForms to create surveys and polls.<\/p>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/addons\/surveys-and-polls-addon\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">WordPress Survey plugin addon<\/a> comes with smart survey fields including likert scale, star ratings, multiple choice, Net Promoter Score (NPS), and more, so you can create custom survey forms like Survey Monkey (without the high costs).<\/p>\n<p>WPForms offer the best-in class survey reporting. You can use our interactive reports to customize the graphs, export them for your presentations, and even display the aggregate results to your users.<\/p>\n<p>The best part about WPForms survey reports is that it can retroactively work on any old contact form or feedback survey contact form created with WPForms.<\/p>\n<p>Thousands of businesses love WPForms surveys for creating employee feedback form, customer feedback form, online petition form, and more.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use the surveys &amp; polls addon to easily create a poll on your site. To save you time when creating a user poll, we have added a built-in poll forms template. Our poll feature offers real-time reports, so you can share poll results with the user immediately after they submit their vote.<\/p>\n<p>Just like the contact form, you can embed your surveys and polls inside any post, page, or widget area in WordPress.<\/p>\n<h4>Membership and Default WordPress Forms<\/h4>\n<p>Aside from building simple contact forms which every WordPress site needs, WPForms also helps you create better default WordPress forms.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you can use WPForms to create custom WordPress login forms and custom WordPress user registration forms which are great for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpbeginner.com\/wp-tutorials\/ultimate-guide-to-creating-a-wordpress-membership-site\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">membership sites<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>For membership sites, you can also use WPForms to create a password-protected contact form or even a members only contact form which is restricited to logged-in users only.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you&#8217;re not using a WordPress membership plugin, you can use WPForms to create membership registration forms, online RSVP forms, and other address book contact forms.<\/p>\n<p>Bloggers and publishers can use our WordPress post submission forms to accept guest posts, testimonials contact form to collect testiomnials, and partnership agreement forms to grow their business.<\/p>\n<h4>Payment Form, Donation Form, Booking Form, and More<\/h4>\n<p>While WPForms started out as a contact form plugin, it has evolved into a powerful forms solution that you can use to create a payment form, donation form, registration form, online booking form, and more.<\/p>\n<p>WPForms integrates with both PayPal and Stripe, so you can easily create a credit card payment form to accept payments on your website. If you&#8217;re using SSL, then you can use our Stripe Payment form to accept credit card payments. Alternatively you can use our PayPal payment form to make a donation form and accept payments online.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from simple order forms, business owners also use WPForms to create custom product purchase forms, t-shirt order forms, online booking forms, and more.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that sometimes you may need to create a contact form that require a signature. WPForms comes with a signature field to collect user signature on your WordPress forms or even create custom signature forms.<\/p>\n<p>You can do all of this while still using the same easy-to-use contact form builder that&#8217;s loved by over 3 million users.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I am so impressed with this plugin. I decided to give it a shot over some of the other form plugins, and I am so glad I did. It works well, is so easy to use and customize. The support is amazing on top of it all. I got the pro version because I was so pleased. Highly recommend.<br \/>\n  Micky73 &#8211; WordPress user<\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n<h4>Forms that are Optimized for Conversion and Results<\/h4>\n<p>With our Form Pages addon, you can create distraction-free custom form landing pages like Google Forms and Wufoo right inside WordPress, so you can increase conversions without the high costs (<a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/addons\/form-pages-addon\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">See Form Pages Demo<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>To improve form completion rate, we created Conversational Forms&reg; which helps you make your generic feedback form and other custom contact forms feel more human by adding an interactive form layout. Our conversational forms are similar to Typeform without the high subscription costs (<a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/addons\/conversational-forms-addon\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">See Conversaional Forms Demo<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>WPForms also has other conversion optimization features such as our smart form logic that lets you create dynamic contact forms where fields change based on user&#8217;s answer, multi-page contact forms with progress bar, and other advanced contact forms.<\/p>\n<p>WPForms form analytics integration with MonsterInsights allow you to easily track your lead capture forms, newsletter signup forms, request a quote contact form, and other important forms on your site.<\/p>\n<h4>Easy to Customize and Extend<\/h4>\n<p>You can easily customize your contact forms with our section dividers, HTML blocks, and custom CSS.<\/p>\n<p>We also knew that our developer friends may want to extend simple contact forms further. That&#8217;s why WPForms come with tons of hooks and filters to create custom functionality.<\/p>\n<p>Since contact forms are essential for marketing, WPForms is a must have plugin for every website!<\/p>\n<h4>Full WPForms Feature List<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/features\/drag-drop-online-form-builder\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Online Form Builder<\/a> &#8211; Our powerful drag &amp; drop contact form builder allows you to easily create WordPress contact forms and other online forms in just a few minutes without writing any code.<\/li>\n<li>100% Responsive &#8211; Mobile Friendly contact forms.<\/li>\n<li>GDPR Friendly &#8211; Make your contact form GDPR compatible with just a few clicks.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/features\/form-templates\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteplugin\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">Form Templates<\/a> &#8211; Use our pre-built form templates to save time.

After a html file is generated your webserver will serve that file instead of processing the comparatively heavier and more expensive WordPress PHP scripts.<\/p>\n<p>The static html files will be served to the vast majority of your users:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users who are not logged in.<\/li>\n<li>Users who have not left a comment on your blog.<\/li>\n<li>Or users who have not viewed a password protected post.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>99% of your visitors will be served static html files. One cached file can be served thousands of times. Other visitors will be served custom cached files tailored to their visit. If they are logged in, or have left comments those details will be displayed and cached for them.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin serves cached files in 3 ways (ranked by speed):<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Expert. The fastest method is by using Apache mod_rewrite (or whatever similar module your web server supports) to serve &#8220;supercached&#8221; static html files. This completely bypasses PHP and is extremely quick. If your server is hit by a deluge of traffic it is more likely to cope as the requests are &#8220;lighter&#8221;. This does require the Apache mod_rewrite module (which is probably installed if you have custom permalinks) and a modification of your .htaccess file which is risky and may take down your site if modified incorrectly.<\/li>\n<li>Simple. Supercached static files can be served by PHP and this is the recommended way of using the plugin. The plugin will serve a &#8220;supercached&#8221; file if it exists and it&#8217;s almost as fast as the mod_rewrite method. It&#8217;s easier to configure as the .htaccess file doesn&#8217;t need to be changed. You still need a custom permalink. You can keep portions of your page dynamic in this caching mode.<\/li>\n<li>WP-Cache caching. This is mainly used to cache pages for known users, URLs with parameters and feeds. Known users are logged in users, visitors who leave comments or those who should be shown custom per-user data. It&#8217;s the most flexible caching method and slightly slower. WP-Cache caching will also cache visits by unknown users if supercaching is disabled. You can have dynamic parts to your page in this mode too. This mode is always enabled but you can disable caching for known users, URLs with parameters, or feeds separately. Set the constant &#8220;DISABLE_SUPERCACHE&#8221; to 1 in your wp-config.php if you want to only use WP-Cache caching.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not comfortable with editing PHP files then use simple mode. It&#8217;s easy to set up and very fast.<\/p>\n<h3>Recommended Settings<\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Simple caching.<\/li>\n<li>Compress pages.<\/li>\n<li>Don&#8217;t cache pages for known users.<\/li>\n<li>Cache rebuild.<\/li>\n<li>CDN support.<\/li>\n<li>Extra homepage checks.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Garbage collection is the act of cleaning up cache files that are out of date and stale. There&#8217;s no correct value for the expiry time but a good starting point is 1800 seconds.<\/p>\n<p>Consider deleting the contents of the &#8220;Rejected User Agents&#8221; text box and allow search engines to cache files for you.<\/p>\n<p>Preload as many posts as you can and enable &#8220;Preload Mode&#8221;. Garbage collection of old cached files will be disabled. If you don&#8217;t care about sidebar widgets updating often set the preload interval to 2880 minutes (2 days) so all your posts aren&#8217;t recached very often. When the preload occurs the cache files for the post being refreshed is deleted and then regenerated. Afterwards a garbage collection of all old files is performed to clean out stale cache files.<br \/>\nEven with preload mode enabled cached files will still be deleted when posts are modified or comments made.<\/p>\n<h3>Development<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Active development of this plugin is handled <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Automattic\/wp-super-cache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">on GitHub<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Translation of the plugin into different languages is on the <a href=\"https:\/\/translate.wordpress.org\/projects\/wp-plugins\/wp-super-cache\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">translation page<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Documentation<\/h3>\n<p>If you need more information than the following, you can have a look at the <a href=\"https:\/\/odd.blog\/wp-super-cache-developers\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Developer documentation<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Preloading<\/h4>\n<p>You can generate cached files for the posts, categories and tags of your site by preloading. Preloading will visit each page of your site generating a cached page as it goes along, just like any other visitor to the site. Due to the sequential nature of this function, it can take some time to preload a complete site if there are many posts.<br \/>\nTo make preloading more effective it can be useful to disable garbage collection so that older cache files are not deleted. This is done by enabling &#8220;Preload Mode&#8221; in the settings. Be aware however, that pages will go out of date eventually but that updates by submitting comments or editing posts will clear portions of the cache.<\/p>\n<h4>Garbage Collection<\/h4>\n<p>Your cache directory fills up over time, which takes up space on your server. If space is limited or billed by capacity, or if you worry that the cached pages of your site will go stale then garbage collection has to be done. Garbage collection happens on a regular basis and deletes old files in the cache directory. On the advanced settings page you can specify:<br \/>\n1. Cache timeout. How long cache files are considered fresh for. After this time they are stale and can be deleted.<br \/>\n2. Scheduler. Setup how often garbage collection should be done.<br \/>\n3. Notification emails. You can be informed on garbage collection job progress.<br \/>\nThere&#8217;s no right or wrong settings for garbage collection. It depends on your own site.<br \/>\nIf your site gets regular updates, or comments then set the timeout to 1800 seconds, and set the timer to 600 seconds.<br \/>\nIf your site is mostly static you can disable garbage collection by entering 0 as the timeout, or use a really large timeout value.<\/p>\n<p>The cache directory, usually wp-content\/cache\/ is only for temporary files. Do not ever put important files or symlinks to important files or directories in that directory. They will be deleted if the plugin has write access to them.<\/p>\n<h4>CDN<\/h4>\n<p>A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is usually a network of computers situated around the world that will serve the content of your website faster by using servers close to you. Static files like images, Javascript and CSS files can be served through these networks to speed up how fast your site loads. You can also create a &#8220;poor man&#8217;s CDN&#8221; by using a sub domain of your domain to serve static files too.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/ossdl-cdn-off-linker\/\">OSSDL CDN off-linker<\/a> has been integrated into WP Super Cache to provide basic CDN support. It works by rewriting the URLs of files (excluding .php files) in wp-content and wp-includes on your server so they point at a different hostname. Many CDNs support <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/search?hl=en&amp;q=%22origin+pull%22\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">origin pull<\/a>. This means the CDN will download the file automatically from your server when it&#8217;s first requested, and will continue to serve it for a configurable length of time before downloading it again from your server.<\/p>\n<p>Configure this on the &#8220;CDN&#8221; tab of the plugin settings page. This is an advanced technique and requires a basic understanding of how your webserver or CDNs work. Please be sure to clear the file cache after you configure the CDN.<\/p>\n<h4>REST API<\/h4>\n<p>There are now REST API endpoints for accessing the settings of this plugin. You&#8217;ll need to be authenticated as an admin user with permission to view the settings page to use it. This has not been documented yet but you can find all the code that deals with this in the &#8220;rest&#8221; directory.<\/p>\n<h4>Custom Caching<\/h4>\n<p>It is now possible to hook into the caching process using the add_cacheaction() function.<\/p>\n<p>Three hooks are available:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>&#8216;wp_cache_get_cookies_values&#8217; &#8211; modify the key used by WP Cache.<\/li>\n<li>&#8216;add_cacheaction&#8217; &#8211; runs in phase2. Allows a plugin to add WordPress hooks.<\/li>\n<li>&#8216;cache_admin_page&#8217; &#8211; runs in the admin page. Use it to modify that page, perhaps by adding new configuration options.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>There is one regular WordPress filter too. Use the &#8220;do_createsupercache&#8221; filter<br \/>\nto customize the checks made before caching. The filter accepts one parameter.<br \/>\nThe output of WP-Cache&#8217;s wp_cache_get_cookies_values() function.<\/p>\n<p>WP Super Cache has its own plugin system. This code is loaded when WP Super Cache loads and can be used to change how caching is done. This is before most of WordPress loads so some functionality will not be available. Plugins can be located anywhere that PHP can load them. Add your own plugin either:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>by putting your plugin in the wp-content\/plugins\/wp-super-cache-plugins directory, or<\/li>\n<li>by calling wpsc_add_plugin( $name ) where $name is the full filename and path to the plugin. You only need to call that function once to add it. Use wpsc_delete_plugin( $name ) to remove it from the list of loaded plugins.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The cookies WP Super Cache uses to identify &#8220;known users&#8221; can be modified now by adding the names of those cookies to a list in the plugin configuration. Use wpsc_add_cookie( $name ) to add a new cookie, and wpsc_delete_cookie( $name ) to remove it. The cookie names also modify the mod_rewrite rules used by the plugin but I recommend using Simple mode caching to avoid complications with updating the .htaccess file.<br \/>\nThe cookie name and value are used to differenciate users so you can have one cookie, but different values for each type of user on your site for example. They&#8217;ll be served different cache files.<\/p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/Automattic\/wp-super-cache\/blob\/4cda5c0f2218e40e118232b5bf22d227fb3206b7\/plugins\/searchengine.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">plugins\/searchengine.php<\/a> as an example I use for my <a href=\"https:\/\/odd.blog\/no-adverts-for-friends\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">No Adverts for Friends<\/a> plugin.<\/p>\n<h3>Troubleshooting<\/h3>\n<p>If things don&#8217;t work when you installed the plugin here are a few things to check:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Is wp-content writable by the web server?<\/li>\n<li>Is there a wp-content\/wp-cache-config.php ? If not, copy the file wp-super-cache\/wp-cache-config-sample.php to wp-content\/wp-cache-config.php and make sure WPCACHEHOME points at the right place.<\/li>\n<li>Is there a wp-content\/advanced-cache.php ? If not, then you must copy wp-super-cache\/advanced-cache.php into wp-content\/. You must edit the file and change the path so it points at the wp-super-cache folder.<\/li>\n<li>If pages are not cached at all, remove wp-content\/advanced-cache.php and recreate it, following the advice above.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Make sure the following line is in wp-config.php and it is ABOVE the &#8220;require_once(ABSPATH.&#8217;wp-settings.php&#8217;);&#8221; line:<\/p>\n<pre><code>define( 'WP_CACHE', true );\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>Try the Settings-&gt;WP Super Cache page again and enable cache.<\/li>\n<li>Look in wp-content\/cache\/supercache\/. Are there directories and files there?<\/li>\n<li>Anything in your php error_log?<\/li>\n<li>If your browser keeps asking you to save the file after the super cache is installed you must disable Super Cache compression. Go to the Settings-&gt;WP Super Cache page and disable it there.<\/li>\n<li>The plugin does not work very well when PHP&#8217;s safe mode is active. This must be disabled by your administrator.<\/li>\n<li>If pages are randomly super cached and sometimes not, your blog can probably be viewed with and without the &#8220;www&#8221; prefix on the URL. You should choose one way and install the <a href=\"http:\/\/txfx.net\/code\/wordpress\/enforce-www-preference\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Enforce www preference<\/a> plugin if you are using an old WordPress install. The latest versions redirect themselves (you should always be running the latest version of WordPress anyway!)<\/li>\n<li>Private Server users at Dreamhost should edit wp-content\/wp-cache-config.php and set the cache dir to &#8220;\/tmp\/&#8221; if they are getting errors about increasing CPU usage. See this <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/topic\/145895?replies=42\">discussion<\/a> for more.<\/li>\n<li>File locking errors such as &#8220;failed to acquire key 0x152b: Permission denied in&#8230;&#8221; or &#8220;Page not cached by WP Super Cache. Could not get mutex lock.&#8221; are a sign that you may have to use file locking. Edit wp-content\/wp-cache-config.php and uncomment &#8220;$use_flock = true&#8221; or set $sem_id to a different value. You can also disable file locking from the Admin screen as a last resort.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure cache\/wp_cache_mutex.lock is writable by the web server if using coarse file locking.<\/li>\n<li>The cache folder cannot be put on an NFS or Samba or NAS share. It has to be on a local disk. File locking and deleting expired files will not work properly unless the cache folder is on the local machine.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Garbage collection of old cache files won&#8217;t work if WordPress can&#8217;t find wp-cron.php. If your hostname resolves to 127.0.0.1 it could be preventing the garbage collection from working. Check your access_logs for wp-cron.php entries. Do they return a 404 (file not found) or 200 code? If it&#8217;s 404 or you don&#8217;t see wp-cron.php anywhere WordPress may be looking for that script in the wrong place. You should speak to your server administator to correct this or edit \/etc\/hosts on Unix servers and remove the following line. Your hostname must resolve to the external IP address other servers on the network\/Internet use. See http:\/\/yoast.com\/wp-cron-issues\/ for more. A line like &#8220;127.0.0.1 localhost localhost.localdomain&#8221; is ok.<\/p>\n<pre><code>127.0.0.1 example.com\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>If old pages are being served to your visitors via the supercache, you may be missing Apache modules (or their equivalents if you don&#8217;t use Apache). 3 modules are required: mod_mime, mod_headers and mod_expires. The last two are especially important for making sure browsers load new versions of existing pages on your site.<\/li>\n<li>The error message, &#8220;WP Super Cache is installed but broken. The path to wp-cache-phase1.php in wp-content\/advanced-cache.php must be fixed!&#8221; appears at the end of every page. Open the file wp-content\/advanced-cache.php in your favourite editor. Is the path to wp-cache-phase1.php correct? This file will normally be in wp-content\/plugins\/wp-super-cache\/. If it is not correct the caching engine will not load.<\/li>\n<li>Caching doesn&#8217;t work. The timestamp on my blog keeps changing when I reload. Check that the path in your .htaccess rules matches where the supercache directory is. You may have to hardcode it. Try disabling supercache mode.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If supercache cache files are generated but not served, check the permissions on all your wp-content\/cache\/supercache folders (and each of wp-content cache and supercache folders) and wp-content\/cache\/.htaccess. If your PHP runs as a different user to Apache and permissions are strict Apache may not be able to read the PHP generated cache files. To fix you must add the following line to your wp-config.php (Add it above the WP_CACHE define.) Then clear your cache.<\/p>\n<pre><code>umask( 0022 );\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If you see garbage in your browser after enabling compression in the plugin, compression may already be enabled in your web server. In Apache you must disable mod_deflate, or in PHP zlib compression may be enabled. You can disable that in three ways. If you have root access, edit your php.ini and find the zlib.output_compression setting and make sure it&#8217;s &#8220;Off&#8221; or add this line to your .htaccess:<\/p>\n<pre><code>php_flag zlib.output_compression off\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work, add this line to your wp-config.php:<\/p>\n<pre><code>ini_set('zlib.output_compression', 0);\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>The &#8220;white screen of death&#8221; or a blank page  when you visit your site is almost always caused by a PHP error but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.johnberns.com\/2010\/03\/19\/wp-super-cache-blank-page-problem-fixed\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">it may also be caused by APC<\/a>. Disable that PHP extension if you have trouble and replace with eAccelerator or Xcache.<\/li>\n<li>After uninstalling, your permalinks may break if you remove the WordPress mod_rewrite rules too. Regenerate those rules by visiting the Settings-&gt;Permalink page and saving that form again.<\/li>\n<li>If your blog refuses to load make sure your wp-config.php is correct. Are you missing an opening or closing PHP tag?<\/li>\n<li>Your front page is ok but posts and pages give a 404? Go to Settings-&gt;permalinks and click &#8220;Save&#8221; once you&#8217;ve selected a custom permalink structure. You may need to manually update your .htaccess file.<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>If certain characters do not appear correctly on your website your server may not be configured correctly. You need to tell visitors what character set is used. Go to Settings-&gt;Reading and copy the &#8216;Encoding for pages and feeds&#8217; value. Edit the .htaccess file with all your Supercache and WordPress rewrite rules and add this at the top, replacing CHARSET with the copied value. (for example, &#8216;UTF-8&#8217;)<\/p>\n<pre><code>AddDefaultCharset CHARSET\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<\/li>\n<li>Use <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/cron-view\/\">Cron View<\/a> to help diagnose garbage collection and preload problems. Use the plugin to make sure jobs are scheduled and for what time. Look for the wp_cache_gc and wp_cache_full_preload_hook jobs.<\/li>\n<li>The error message, &#8220;WP Super Cache is installed but broken. The constant WPCACHEHOME must be set in the file wp-config.php and point at the WP Super Cache plugin directory.&#8221; appears at the end of every page. You can delete wp-content\/advanced-cache.php and reload the plugin settings page or edit wp-config.php and look for WPCACHEHOME and make sure it points at the wp-super-cache folder. This will normally be wp-content\/plugins\/wp-super-cache\/ but you&#8217;ll likely need the full path to that file (so it&#8217;s easier to let the settings page fix it). If it is not correct the caching engine will not load.<\/li>\n<li>If your server is running into trouble because of the number of semaphores used by the plugin it&#8217;s because your users are using file locking which is not recommended (but is needed by a small number of users). You can globally disable file locking by defining the constant WPSC_DISABLE_LOCKING, or defining the constant WPSC_REMOVE_SEMAPHORE so that sem_remove() is called after every page is cached but that seems to cause problems for other processes requesting the same semaphore. Best to disable it.<\/li>\n<li>Set the variable $htaccess_path in wp-config.php or wp-cache-config.php to the path of your global .htaccess if the plugin is looking for that file in the wrong directory. This might happen if you have WordPress installed in an unusual way.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","short_description":"A very fast caching engine for WordPress that produces static html files.","download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/wp-super-cache.1.7.1.zip","tags":{"cache":"cache","caching":"caching","performance":"performance","wp-cache":"WP Cache","wp-super-cache":"WP Super Cache"},"donate_link":"","icons":{"1x":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-super-cache\/assets\/icon-128x128.png?rev=1095422","2x":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/wp-super-cache\/assets\/icon-256x256.png?rev=1095422"}},{"name":"MC4WP: Mailchimp for WordPress","slug":"mailchimp-for-wp","version":"4.8","author":"<a href=\"https:\/\/ibericode.com\/\">ibericode<\/a>","author_profile":"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dvankooten","requires":"4.6","tested":"5.4.2","requires_php":"5.3","rating":96,"ratings":{"5":1177,"4":33,"3":16,"2":10,"1":34},"num_ratings":1270,"support_threads":73,"support_threads_resolved":69,"active_installs":1000000,"downloaded":28879599,"last_updated":"2020-07-09 9:27am GMT","added":"2013-06-19","homepage":"https:\/\/www.mc4wp.com\/#utm_source=wp-plugin&utm_medium=mailchimp-for-wp&utm_campaign=plugins-page","description":"<h4>Mailchimp for WordPress<\/h4>\n<p><em>Allowing your visitors to subscribe to your newsletter should be easy.

You&#8217;re not alone. Over 1 million websites use WP Mail SMTP to send their emails reliably.<\/p>\n<p>Our goal is to make email deliverability easy and reliable. We want to ensure your emails reach the inbox.<\/p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP fixes your email deliverability by reconfiguring WordPress to use a proper SMTP provider when sending emails.<\/p>\n<h4>What is SMTP?<\/h4>\n<p>SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is an industry standard for sending emails. Proper SMTP configuration helps increase email deliverability by using authentication.<\/p>\n<p>Popular email clients like Gmail, Yahoo, and Office 365 are in a constant battle with email spammers. One of the things they look at is if an email is originating from the location it claims to be originating from.<\/p>\n<p>If the proper authentication isn&#8217;t there, then emails either go in the SPAM folder or worst, don&#8217;t get delivered at all.<\/p>\n<p>This is a problem for a lot of WordPress sites because by default, WordPress uses the PHP mail function to send emails generated by WordPress or any contact form plugin like <a href=\"https:\/\/wpforms.com\/\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">WPForms<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The issue is that most <a  rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">WordPress hosting companies<\/a> don&#8217;t have their servers properly configured for sending PHP emails.<\/p>\n<p>The combination of two causes your WordPress emails to not get delivered.<\/p>\n<h4>How does WP Mail SMTP work?<\/h4>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin easily resolves email delivery problems by improving and changing how your WordPress site sends email. We reconfigure the <code>wp_mail()<\/code> function to either use proper SMTP host credentials or leverage a built-in SMTP mail provider.<\/p>\n<p>When using one of our built-in SMTP mail provider integrations (recommended), emails are sent using the provider&#8217;s direct API. This means even if your web host is blocking SMTP ports, your emails still send successfully.<\/p>\n<p>This helps you fix all WordPress not sending email issues.<\/p>\n<p>WP Mail SMTP plugin includes many different SMTP setup options:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>SMTP.com <strong>(Recommended)<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Pepipost SMTP <strong>(Recommended)<\/strong><\/li>\n<li>Sendinblue SMTP<\/li>\n<li>Mailgun SMTP<\/li>\n<li>SendGrid SMTP<\/li>\n<li>Gmail SMTP<\/li>\n<li>Microsoft SMTP (Outlook.com and Office 365) <a href=\"https:\/\/wpmailsmtp.com\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteversion&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">[Pro]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Amazon SES SMTP <a href=\"https:\/\/wpmailsmtp.com\/?utm_source=wprepo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=liteversion&amp;utm_content=readme\" rel=\"friend nofollow ugc\">[Pro]<\/a><\/li>\n<li>All Other SMTP<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For all options, you can specify the &#8220;from name&#8221; and &#8220;email address&#8221; for outgoing emails.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of having users use different SMTP plugins and workflows for different SMTP providers, we decided to bring it all in one.

With it you can easily manage 301 redirections, keep track of 404 errors, and generally tidy up any loose ends your site may have. This can help reduce errors and improve your site ranking.<\/p>\n<p>Redirection is designed to be used on sites with a few redirects to sites with thousands of redirects.<\/p>\n<p>It has been a WordPress plugin for over 10 years and has been recommended countless times. And it&#8217;s free!<\/p>\n<p>Full documentation can be found at <a href=\"https:\/\/redirection.me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">https:\/\/redirection.me<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Redirection is compatible with PHP from 5.6 and upwards (including 7.4).<\/p>\n<h4>Redirect manager<\/h4>\n<p>Create and manage redirects quickly and easily without needing Apache or Nginx knowledge. If your WordPress supports permalinks then you can use Redirection to redirect any URL.<\/p>\n<p>There is full support for regular expressions so you can create redirect patterns to match any number of URLs. You can match query parameters and even pass them through to the target URL.<\/p>\n<p>The plugin can also be configured to monitor when post or page permalinks are changed and automatically create a redirect to the new URL.<\/p>\n<h4>Conditional redirects<\/h4>\n<p>In addition to straightforward URL matching you can redirect based on other conditions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Login status &#8211; redirect only if the user is logged in or logged out<\/li>\n<li>WordPress capability &#8211; redirect if the user is able to perform a certain capability<\/li>\n<li>Browser &#8211; redirect if the user is using a certain browser<\/li>\n<li>Referrer &#8211; redirect if the user visited the link from another page<\/li>\n<li>Cookies &#8211; redirect if a particular cookie is set<\/li>\n<li>HTTP headers &#8211; redirect based on a HTTP header<\/li>\n<li>Custom filter &#8211; redirect based on your own WordPress filter<\/li>\n<li>IP address &#8211; redirect if the client IP address matches<\/li>\n<li>Server &#8211; redirect another domain if also hosted on this server<\/li>\n<li>Page type &#8211; redirect if the current page is a 404<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Full logging<\/h4>\n<p>A configurable logging option allows to view all redirects occurring on your site, including information about the visitor, the browser used, and the referrer. A &#8216;hit&#8217; count is maintained for each redirect so you can see if a URL is being used.<\/p>\n<p>Logs can be exported for external viewing, and can be searched and filtered for more detailed investigation.<\/p>\n<p>Display geographic information about an IP address, as well as a full user agent information, to try and understand who the visitor is.<\/p>\n<p>You are able to disable or reduce IP collection to meet the legal requirements of your geographic region.<\/p>\n<h4>Add HTTP headers<\/h4>\n<p>HTTP headers can be adder to redirects or your entire site that help reduce the impact of redirects or help increase security. You can also add your own custom headers.<\/p>\n<h4>Track 404 errors<\/h4>\n<p>Redirection will keep track of all 404 errors that occur on your site, allowing you to track down and fix problems.<\/p>\n<p>Errors can be grouped to show where you should focus your attention, and can be redirected in bulk.<\/p>\n<h4>Query parameter handling<\/h4>\n<p>You can match query parameters exactly, ignore them, and even pass them through to your target.<\/p>\n<h4>Apache &amp; Nginx support<\/h4>\n<p>By default Redirection will manage all redirects using WordPress. However you can configure it so redirects are automatically saved to a .htaccess file and handled by Apache itself.<\/p>\n<p>If you use Nginx then you can export redirects to an Nginx rewrite rules file.<\/p>\n<h4>Fine-grained permissions<\/h4>\n<p>Fine-grained permissions are available so you can customise the plugin for different users. This makes it particularly suitable for client sites where you may want to prevent certain actions, and remove functionality.<\/p>\n<h4>Import &amp; Export<\/h4>\n<p>The plugin has a fully-featured import and export system and you can:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Import and export to Apache .htaccess<\/li>\n<li>Export to Nginx rewrite rules<\/li>\n<li>Copy redirects between sites using JSON<\/li>\n<li>Import and export to CSV for viewing in a spreadsheet<\/li>\n<li>Use WP CLI to automate import and export<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can also import from the following plugins:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simple 301 Redirects<\/li>\n<li>SEO Redirection<\/li>\n<li>Safe Redirect Manager<\/li>\n<li>Rank Math<\/li>\n<li>WordPress old slug redirects<\/li>\n<li>Quick Post\/Pages redirects<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Search Regex compatible<\/h4>\n<p>Redirection is compatible with <a href=\"https:\/\/searchregex.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Search Regex<\/a>, allowing you to bulk update your redirects.<\/p>\n<h4>Wait, it&#8217;s free?<\/h4>\n<p>Yes, it&#8217;s really free.

Use the API to customize smart purging, customize cache rules, create cache varies, and make WP nonce cacheable, among other things.<\/p>\n<h3>Privacy<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin includes a Privacy blurb that you can add to your site&#8217;s Privacy Policy via the WordPress Privacy settings.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For your own information:<\/strong> LiteSpeed Cache for WordPress potentially stores a duplicate copy of every web page on display on your site. The pages are stored locally on the system where LiteSpeed server software is installed and are not transferred to or accessed by LiteSpeed employees in any way, except as necessary in providing routine technical support if you request it. All cache files are temporary, and may easily be purged before their natural expiration, if necessary, via a Purge All command. It is up to individual site administrators to come up with their own cache expiration rules.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to caching, our WordPress plugin has an Image Optimization feature. When optimization is requested, images are transmitted to a remote QUIC.cloud server, processed, and then transmitted back for use on your site. LiteSpeed keeps copies of optimized images for 7 days (in case of network stability issues) and then permanently deletes them. Similarly, the WordPress plugin has a Reporting feature whereby a site owner can transmit an environment report to our server so that we may better provide technical support. Neither of these features collects any visitor data. Only server and site data is involved.<\/p>\n<p>Please see <a href=\"https:\/\/www.litespeedtech.com\/company\/privacy-policy\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">LiteSpeed\u2019s Privacy Policy<\/a> for our complete Privacy\/GDPR statement.<\/p>\n","short_description":"All-in-one unbeatable acceleration &amp; PageSpeed improvement: caching, image\/CSS\/JS optimization...","download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/litespeed-cache.3.2.4.zip","tags":{"caching":"caching","optimize":"Optimize","pagespeed":"pagespeed","performance":"performance","seo":"seo"},"donate_link":"","icons":{"1x":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litespeed-cache\/assets\/icon-128x128.png?rev=1574145","2x":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/litespeed-cache\/assets\/icon-256x256.png?rev=1574145"}},{"name":"Coming Soon Page, Under Construction &amp; Maintenance Mode by SeedProd","slug":"coming-soon","version":"5.1.3","author":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.seedprod.com\">SeedProd<\/a>","author_profile":"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/seedprod","requires":"3.5.1","tested":"5.4.2","requires_php":false,"rating":100,"ratings":{"5":3765,"4":43,"3":5,"2":2,"1":19},"num_ratings":3834,"support_threads":28,"support_threads_resolved":27,"active_installs":1000000,"downloaded":9673083,"last_updated":"2020-07-16 1:45pm GMT","added":"2014-01-21","homepage":"http:\/\/www.seedprod.com","description":"<p>Create a simple Coming Soon Page, Under Construction or Maintenance Mode Page.

The detailed tests result will provide you with additional information on what can be optimized more.<\/p>\n<h4>Plugin Compatibility<\/h4>\n<p>If your plugin does not trigger standard WordPress hooks or you need us to purge the cache, you can use this public function in your code:<\/p>\n<pre><code>if (function_exists('sg_cachepress_purge_cache')) {\n    sg_cachepress_purge_cache();\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Preferrably, you can pass an URL to the function to clear the cache just for it instead of purging the entire cache. For example:<\/p>\n<pre><code>if (function_exists('sg_cachepress_purge_cache')) {\n    sg_cachepress_purge_cache('https:\/\/yoursite.com\/pluginpage');\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>You can exclude styles from being combined and minified using the filters we\u2019ve designed for that purpose.

This simple, popular and highly effective tool has everything you need to keep your website fast and thoroughly optimized!<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed-vimeo\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/333705073\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>It does it in three clever ways:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>It allows you to clean and optimise your database.<\/li>\n<li>It gives you the option to compress your images.<\/li>\n<li>It allows you cache your pages, for super fast load times (read more caching information below).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Extensive tests show the cache feature alone can make WordPress sites faster than any other caching plugin available.  But when you combine the cache with the database and image optimize features, the difference with alternative solutions is significant.<\/p>\n<h4>1. Cleans the database<\/h4>\n<p>Your WordPress database stores everything that you need for your website \u2013 plus many things that you don\u2019t. WP-Optimize clears out all of this unnecessary data, cleans up your tables and even retrieves space lost to data fragmentation.<\/p>\n<p>Mobile-friendly and incredibly simple to use, it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Removes all unnecessary data (e.g. trashed\/unapproved\/spam comments, stale data) plus pingbacks, trackbacks and expired transient options<\/li>\n<li>Compacts\/de-fragment MySQL tables with a button-press<\/li>\n<li>Detailed control of which optimizations you wish to carry out<\/li>\n<li>Carries out automatic weekly (or otherwise) clean-ups<\/li>\n<li>Retains a set number of weeks\u2019 data during clean-ups<\/li>\n<li>Performs optimizations without the need for running manual queries<\/li>\n<li>Automatically trigger a pre-optimize backup via <a href=\"https:\/\/updraftplus.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">UpdraftPlus<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Show database statistics and potential savings<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Why is this important?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tables in MySQL (the database that WordPress uses) will, over time, become inefficient as data is added, removed, moved around. Asking MySQL to optimize its tables every now and again will keep your site running as fast as possible. It won\u2019t happen by itself.<\/li>\n<li>Every-time you save a new post or pages, WordPress creates a revision of that post or page. If you edit a post 6 times you might have 5 copy of that post as revisions. This quickly adds lots of rarely-used data to your database tables, making them unnecessarily bloated, and slower to access.<\/li>\n<li>There might be thousands of spam and un-approved comments in your comments table, WP-Optimize can clean and remove those in a single click.<\/li>\n<li>WP-Optimize reports which database tables have overhead and wasted spaces also it allows you to shrink and get rid of those wasted spaces.<\/li>\n<li>Automatically cleans your database every week and respects the \u201cKeep last [selected number] weeks data\u201d option.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>WP-Optimize helps you to:<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Make space:<\/strong> When you edit a post or page on your website, WordPress automatically saves the new revision to the database. If you edit things a few times (and particularly if the post is long), your database soon gets clogged up with old revisions that just sit there, taking up valuable space. WP-Optimize removes these unnecessary post revisions, freeing up valuable Megabytes of data and increasing speed and efficiency. It also cleans up your comments table, removing all the spam and un-approved comments that have built up with a single click.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Take control:<\/strong> WP-Optimize reports on exactly which of your database tables have overhead and wasted space, giving you the insight, control and power to keep your website neat, fast and efficient.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Keep it clean and fast:<\/strong> Once enabled, WP-Optimize can run an automatic clean-up on a schedule, keeping a selected number of weeks\u2019 data, according to your specification.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2. Compresses images<\/h4>\n<p>Loading large images is often the biggest culprit in slowing your site\u2019s loading time.<\/p>\n<p>WP-Optimize also has an image-compression tool that uses cutting-edge lossy compression techniques to convert large images (which take a long time to load up) into compressed files saved in your image library, where they can be uploaded in an instant.<\/p>\n<p>It enables you to compress PNG, JPG, GIF, BMP and TIF pictures up to 5MG in size, and it\u2019s packed with other useful features, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bulk compression<\/strong>, allowing you to compress multiple existing images at the same time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Intelligent, multi-pass lossy compression algorithm<\/strong>, which gives you twice the compression with much less loss of resolution.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u2018Restore Originals\u2019 function<\/strong>, which allows you to retrieve or revert back to your original images at any point.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Auto-compress function<\/strong>, which automatically compress images as they\u2019re added to the site. <\/li>\n<li><strong>EXIF Data-Keeping<\/strong> means image information is retained even once the image is compressed.<\/li>\n<li><strong>\u2018Compress Big Files function\u2019<\/strong> allowing you to compress images up to 64MB- much higher than any other plugin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Smaller yet high quality images means significantly faster page loading times and frees up server space and bandwidth for more customers.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Caches pages<\/h4>\n<p><strong>Page caching is probably what will make the biggest difference to your website&#8217;s performance. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Caching involves keeping dynamic data in a temporary storage area so that it can be retrieved in an instant. Caching is a sure-fire way to ensure that web pages load at lightning-fast speed.<\/p>\n<p>Practically, our powerful yet simple cache feature generates the cache when a visitor visits any page or post on your site. WordPress processes the dynamic php files to generate that page, and we save it into a static html file in the cache folder, so that when the next user visits, the page is cached and doesn&#8217;t need processing. This caching results in a much faster loading time, and  gives a slight break to your server. So caching increases speed and performance while reducing the server&#8217;s use of resources.<\/p>\n<p>With minimal configuration, caching your site with WP-Optimize is easy to do thanks to a load of useful features, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cache preloading<\/strong> to ensure the cache is always ready and loaded.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Gzip compression<\/strong> of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to reduce site load time.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Device-Specific cache<\/strong> to ensure the optimized page version is always served.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Advanced cache exclusion rules<\/strong>, so that you can cache almost anything by excluding logged in users, specific URLs or cookies.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Browser Cache<\/strong> to instruct client browsers to reuse cached resources (HTML, CSS, JS) if no changes were made since the last request. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Overall WP-Optimize brings the best cache and optimization technology together in a single seamless plugin to make your WordPress site fast, lean and efficient.<\/p>\n<h4>Combine and minify CSS and JavaScript<\/h4>\n<p>On top of its three main features, WP-Optimize also has the more advanced <strong>minification<\/strong> feature. Combining and minifying your site&#8217;s assets will reduce the number of requests to your server (by combining them) and reduce their size (by minifying their content).<\/p>\n<p>Together with caching and Gzip compression, this will improve the performance and time to &#8220;first contentful paint&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h4>WP-Optimize Premium<\/h4>\n<p>Our free version of WP-Optimize is great, but we also have an even more powerful Premium version with extra features that offer the ultimate in freedom and flexibility:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Multisite Support:<\/strong> extends database optimisations so they function for multiple WordPress sites at a time. If you manage more than one website, you will need WP-Optimize Premium.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Flexibility and Control:<\/strong> gives you the power to optimize select individual tables or a particular combination of tables on one or more WordPress websites, rather than having to optimize all database tables.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Deleting unused and unwanted images:<\/strong> removes orphaned images from your WordPress site, plus images of a certain, pre-defined size.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Sophisticated Scheduling:<\/strong> offers a wide range of options for scheduling automatic optimization. Specify an exact time and run clean-ups daily, weekly, fortnightly or monthly and perform any number of additional once off optimizations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Seamless Graphical User Interface:<\/strong> for superb clarity in scheduling and managing of multi-site optimizations.<\/li>\n<li><strong>WP-CLI support:<\/strong> provides a way to manage optimizations from command-line interface if you have lots of sites<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lazy Loading:<\/strong> load only the images and part of a web-page when it is visible to the user so they can see something very quickly.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Optimization Preview:<\/strong> gives users the ability to preview, select and remove data and records available for optimization from the database.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Premium support<\/strong> &#8211; caching is one of the most complex things you can do for a website, so premium support offers you peace of mind there\u2019s someone to talk quickly to if you need any technical answers or help configuring the optimizations or cache settings for your website.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Translations<\/h4>\n<p>Translators are welcome to contribute to the plugin.

Each table has a unique ID that needs to be adjusted in that Shortcode.<\/p>\n<p>After that, you might want to change the styling of the table. You can do this by entering CSS commands into the &#8220;Custom CSS&#8221; textarea on the &#8220;Plugin Options&#8221; screen. Some examples for common styling changes can be found on the <a href=\"https:\/\/tablepress.org\/faq\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">TablePress FAQ page<\/a>.<br \/>\nYou may also add certain features (like sorting, pagination, filtering, alternating row colors, row highlighting, print name and\/or description, &#8230;) by enabling the corresponding checkboxes on a table&#8217;s &#8220;Edit&#8221; screen.<\/p>\n<h3>Acknowledgements<\/h3>\n<p>Special thanks go to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.sprymedia.co.uk\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Allan Jardine<\/a> for the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.datatables.net\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">DataTables JavaScript library<\/a>.<br \/>\nThanks to all language file translators!<br \/>\nThanks to every donor, supporter, and bug reporter!<\/p>\n<h3>License<\/h3>\n<p>This plugin is Free Software, released and licensed under the GPL, version 2 (https:\/\/www.gnu.org\/licenses\/gpl-2.0.html).<br \/>\nYou may use it free of charge for any purpose.<\/p>\n","short_description":"Embed beautiful and feature-rich tables into your posts and pages, without having to write code.","download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/tablepress.1.11.zip","tags":{"csv":"csv","data":"data","excel":"excel","spreadsheet":"spreadsheet","table":"table"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/tablepress.org\/donate\/","icons":{"1x":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tablepress\/assets\/icon-128x128.png?rev=1064192","2x":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/tablepress\/assets\/icon-256x256.png?rev=1064192"}},{"name":"Mailchimp for WooCommerce","slug":"mailchimp-for-woocommerce","version":"2.4.3","author":"<a href=\"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\">Mailchimp<\/a>","author_profile":"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/mcsupport","requires":"4.9","tested":"5.4.2","requires_php":"7.0","rating":72,"ratings":{"5":227,"4":19,"3":14,"2":12,"1":116},"num_ratings":388,"support_threads":52,"support_threads_resolved":41,"active_installs":800000,"downloaded":7778819,"last_updated":"2020-07-28 9:18pm GMT","added":"2016-10-06","homepage":"https:\/\/mailchimp.com\/connect-your-store\/","description":"<p>Join the 17 million customers who use Mailchimp, the world&#8217;s largest marketing automation platform, to develop their e-commerce marketing strategy.

Increased page speeds can result in better search engine rankings, and will also improve conversion rates (increased sales and signups). It will also save you storage space and bandwidth. While EWWW I.O. will automatically optimize new images that you upload, it can also optimize all the images that you have already uploaded, and optionally convert your images to the best file format. You can choose pixel perfect compression or high compression options that are visually lossless.<\/p>\n<p>EWWW I.O. will optimize images uploaded and created by any plugin, and features special integrations with many popular plugins, detailed below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why use EWWW Image Optimizer?<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>No Speed Limits<\/strong> and <a href=\"https:\/\/ewww.io\/unlimited-file-size\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">unlimited file size<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Smooth Handling<\/strong> with pixel-perfect optimization using industry-leading tools and progressive rendering.<\/li>\n<li><strong>High Torque<\/strong> as we bring you the best compression\/quality ratio available with our lossy options for JPG, PNG, and PDF files.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adaptive Steering<\/strong> with intelligent conversion options to get the right image format for the job (JPG, PNG, or GIF).<\/li>\n<li><strong>Free Parking<\/strong> The core plugin is free and always will be. However, our paid services offer up to 80% compression, and a <a href=\"https:\/\/ewww.io\/plans\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">host of other features<\/a>!<\/li>\n<li><strong>Comprehensive Coverage:<\/strong> no image gets left behind, optimize everything on your site, beyond just the WordPress Media Library.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Safety First:<\/strong> all communications are secured with top SSL encryption.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Roadside Assistance:<\/strong> top-notch support is in our DNA. While API customers get top priority, we answer <a href=\"https:\/\/ewww.io\/contact-us\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">every single support question with care<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Pack a Spare:<\/strong> free image backups store your original images for 30 days.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Images can be optimized using tools on your own server for free (jpegtran, optipng, pngout, pngquant, gifsicle, cwebp), or can be optimized via specialized servers that utilize the best tools available in lossless or lossy mode. Our lossy compression uses unique algorithms to gain maximum compression while remaining visually lossless. Your images can even be converted to the most suitable file format using the appropriate options. Using the EWWW I.O. API will allow the plugin to work on any hosting platform, and can also be desirable if you cannot, or do not want to use the exec() function on your server, or prefer to offload the resource demands of optimization.<\/p>\n<p>If you need a version of this plugin for API use only, see <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/ewww-image-optimizer-cloud\/\">EWWW Image Optimizer Cloud<\/a>. It is much more compact as it does not contain any binaries or any mention of the exec() function.<\/p>\n<h4>Automatic Everything<\/h4>\n<p>With Easy IO, images are automatically compressed, scaled to fit the page and device size, lazy loaded, and converted to the next-gen WebP format.<\/p>\n<h4>Support<\/h4>\n<p>If you need assistance using the plugin, please visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/ewww.io\/contact-us\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Support Page<\/a>.<br \/>\nThe EWWW Image Optimizer is developed at https:\/\/github.com\/nosilver4u\/ewww-image-optimizer<\/p>\n<h4>Bulk Optimize<\/h4>\n<p>Optimize all your images from a single page using the Bulk Scanner. This includes the Media Library, your theme, and a handful of pre-configured folders (see Optimize Everything Else below). Officially supported galleries (GRAND FlaGallery, NextCellent and NextGEN) have their own Bulk Optimize pages.<\/p>\n<h4>Optimize Everything Else<\/h4>\n<p>Configure any folder within your WordPress folder to be optimized. The Bulk Scan under Media-&gt;Bulk Optimize will optimize theme images, BuddyPress avatars, BuddyPress Activity Plus images, Meta Slider slides, WP Symposium Pro avatars, GD bbPress attachments, Grand Media Galleries, and any user-specified folders. Additionally, this tool can run on an hourly basis via wp_cron to keep newly uploaded images optimized. Scheduled optimization should not be used for any plugin that uses the built-in WordPress image functions.<\/p>\n<h4>Skips Previously Optimized Images<\/h4>\n<p>All optimized images are stored in the database so that the plugin does not attempt to re-optimize them unless they are modified. On the Bulk Optimize page you can view a list of already optimized images. You may also remove individual images from the list, or use the Force optimize option to override the default behavior. The re-optimize links on the Media Library page also force the plugin to ignore the previous optimization status of images.<\/p>\n<h4>WP Image Editor<\/h4>\n<p>All images created by the built-in WP_Image_Editor class will be automatically optimized. Current implementations are GD, Imagick, and Gmagick. Images optimized via this class include Animated GIF Resize, BuddyPress Activity Plus (thumbs), Easy Watermark, Hammy, Imsanity, MediaPress, Meta Slider, MyArcadePlugin, OTF Regenerate Thumbnails, Regenerate Thumbnails, Simple Image Sizes, WP Retina 2x, WP RSS Aggregator and probably countless others. If you are not sure if a plugin uses WP_Image_Editor, <a href=\"https:\/\/ewww.io\/contact-us\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">just ask<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>WebP Images<\/h4>\n<p>Automatic WebP conversion with Easy IO, no additional configuration. Otherwise, can generate WebP versions of your images, and enables you to serve even smaller images to supported browsers. Several methods are available for serving WebP images, including Apache-compatible rewrite rules and our JS WebP Rewriting option compatible with caches and CDNs. Also works with the WebP option in the Cache Enabler plugin from KeyCDN.<\/p>\n<h4>WP-CLI<\/h4>\n<p>Allows you to run all Bulk Optimization processes from your command line, instead of the web interface. It is much faster, and allows you to do things like run it in &#8216;screen&#8217; or via regular cron (instead of wp-cron, which can be unpredictable on low-traffic sites). Install WP-CLI from wp-cli.org, and run &#8216;wp-cli.phar help ewwwio optimize&#8217; for more information or see the <a href=\"https:\/\/docs.ewww.io\/article\/25-optimizing-with-wp-cli\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Docs<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>FooGallery<\/h4>\n<p>All images uploaded and cached by FooGallery are automatically optimized. Previous uploads can be optimized by running the Media Library Bulk Optimize. Previously cached images can be optimized by entering the wp-content\/uploads\/cache\/ folder under Folders to Optimize and running a Scan &amp; Optimize from the Bulk Optimize page.<\/p>\n<h4>NextGEN Gallery<\/h4>\n<p>Features optimization on upload capability, re-optimization, and bulk optimizing. The NextGEN Bulk Optimize function is located near the bottom of the NextGEN menu, and will optimize all images in all galleries. It is also possible to optimize groups of images in a gallery, or multiple galleries at once.<\/p>\n<h4>NextCellent Gallery<\/h4>\n<p>Features all the same capability as NextGEN, and is the continuation of legacy (1.9.x) NextGEN support.<\/p>\n<h4>GRAND Flash Album Gallery<\/h4>\n<p>Features optimization on upload capability, re-optimization, and bulk optimizing. The Bulk Optimize function is located near the bottom of the FlAGallery menu, and will optimize all images in all galleries. It is also possible to optimize groups of images in a gallery, or multiple galleries at once.<\/p>\n<h4>Image Store<\/h4>\n<p>Uploads are automatically optimized. Look for Optimize under the Image Store (Galleries) menu to see status of optimization and for re-optimization and bulk-optimization options. Using the Bulk Optimization tool under Media Library automatically includes all Image Store uploads.<\/p>\n<h4>CDN Support<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront\/\">WP Offload Media<\/a> is the officially supported (and recommended) plugin for uploads to Amazon S3 and Digital Ocean Spaces. We also support the Azure Storage and Cloudinary plugins. All pull mode CDNs like Cloudflare, KeyCDN, MaxCDN, and Sucuri CloudProxy work automatically, but will require you to purge the cache after a bulk optimization.<\/p>\n<h4>WPML Compatible<\/h4>\n<p>Tested regularly to ensure compatibility with multilingual sites. Learn more at https:\/\/wpml.org\/plugin\/ewww-image-optimizer\/<\/p>\n<h4>Translations<\/h4>\n<p>Huge thanks to all our translators!

If you need perfect security, you should try other solutions.<\/p>\n<h4>How does it work?<\/h4>\n<p>Really Simple CAPTCHA does not use PHP &#8220;Sessions&#8221; for storing states, unlike many other PHP CAPTCHA solutions, but stores them as temporary files. This allows you to embed it into WordPress without worrying about conflicts.<\/p>\n<p>When you generate a CAPTCHA, Really Simple CAPTCHA creates two files for it; one is an image file of CAPTCHA, and the other is a text file which stores the correct answer to the CAPTCHA.<\/p>\n<p>The two files have the same (random) prefix in their file names, for example, &#8220;a7hk3ux8p.png&#8221; and &#8220;a7hk3ux8p.txt.&#8221; In this case, for example, when the respondent answers &#8220;K5GF&#8221; as an answer to the &#8220;a7hk3ux8p.png&#8221; image, then Really Simple CAPTCHA calculates hash of &#8220;K5GF&#8221; and tests it against the hash stored in the &#8220;a7hk3ux8p.txt&#8221; file. If the two match, the answer is confirmed as correct.<\/p>\n<h4>How to use with your plugin<\/h4>\n<p>Note: Below are instructions for plugin developers.<\/p>\n<p>First, create an instance of ReallySimpleCaptcha class:<\/p>\n<pre><code>$captcha_instance = new ReallySimpleCaptcha();\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>You can change the instance variables as you wish.<\/p>\n<pre><code>\/\/ Change the background color of CAPTCHA image to black\n$captcha_instance-&gt;bg = array( 0, 0, 0 );\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>See really-simple-captcha.php if you are interested in other variables.<\/p>\n<p>Generate a random word for CAPTCHA.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$word = $captcha_instance-&gt;generate_random_word();\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Generate an image file and a corresponding text file in the temporary directory.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$prefix = mt_rand();\n$captcha_instance-&gt;generate_image( $prefix, $word );\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>Then, show the image and get an answer from respondent.<\/p>\n<p>Check the correctness of the answer.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$correct = $captcha_instance-&gt;check( $prefix, $the_answer_from_respondent );\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>If the $correct is true, go ahead. Otherwise, block the respondent &#8212; as it would appear not to be human.<\/p>\n<p>And last, remove the temporary image and text files, as they are no longer in use.<\/p>\n<pre><code>$captcha_instance-&gt;remove( $prefix );\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>That&#8217;s all.<\/p>\n<p>If you wish to see a live sample of this, you can try <a href=\"https:\/\/contactform7.com\/captcha\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Contact Form 7<\/a>.<\/p>\n","short_description":"Really Simple CAPTCHA is a CAPTCHA module intended to be called from other plugins.

Depending on the size of your site this can take from a few minutes up to an hour or more. When parsing is complete, the plugin will start checking each link to see if it works. Again, how long this takes depends on how big your site is and how many links there are. You can monitor the progress and tweak various link checking options in <em>Settings -&gt; Link Checker<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p>The broken links, if any are found, will show up in a new tab of the WP admin panel &#8211; <em>Tools -&gt; Broken Links<\/em>. A notification will also appear in the &#8220;Broken Link Checker&#8221; widget on the Dashboard. To save display space, you can keep the widget closed and configure it to expand automatically when problematic links are detected. E-mail notifications need to be enabled separately (in <em>Settings -&gt; Link Checker<\/em>).<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Broken Links&#8221; tab will by default display a list of broken links that have been detected so far. However, you can use the links on that page to view redirects or see a listing of all links &#8211; working or not &#8211; instead. You can also create new link filters by performing a search and clicking the &#8220;Create Custom Filter&#8221; button. For example, this can be used to create a filter that only shows comment links.<\/p>\n<p>There are several actions associated with each link. They show up when you move your mouse over to one of the links listed the aforementioned tab &#8211;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;Edit URL&#8221; lets you change the URL of that link. If the link is present in more than one place (e.g. both in a post and in the blogroll), all occurrences of that URL will be changed.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Unlink&#8221; removes the link but leaves the link text intact.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Not broken&#8221; lets you manually mark a &#8220;broken&#8221; link as working. This is useful if you know it was incorrectly detected as broken due to a network glitch or a bug. The marked link will still be checked periodically, but the plugin won&#8217;t consider it broken unless it gets a new result.<\/li>\n<li>&#8220;Dismiss&#8221; hides the link from the &#8220;Broken Links&#8221; and &#8220;Redirects&#8221; views.

This plugin was born in 2011 to overcome these limitations. After a long time, in June 2017, version 4.8 of WordPress finally introduced a new text widget that included the ability to manage text widgets with the visual editor. The new widget available in WordPress core could now be used as a basic replacement of Black Studio TinyMCE Widget, but the plugin still offers some additional features, so it remains a must-have for advanced users.<\/p>\n<h4>Basic Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Add rich text widgets to your sidebars and edit them using the TinyMCE visual editor<\/li>\n<li>Switch between Visual mode and HTML mode (including Quicktags toolbar)<\/li>\n<li>Insert images, videos, and other media from WordPress Media Library<\/li>\n<li>Insert links to existing WordPress pages\/posts or external resources<\/li>\n<li>Support for shortcodes, smilies and embed in widget text (including preview)<\/li>\n<li>Support for Customizer with live preview and quick edit<\/li>\n<li>Support for widgets accessibility mode<\/li>\n<li>Compatible with multi-site (WordPress networks)<\/li>\n<li>Compatible with the most common multi-language plugins<\/li>\n<li>Compatible with Page Builder plugin by SiteOrigin<\/li>\n<li>Translations available in 20+ languages<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Advanced Features<\/h4>\n<p>These features are what makes this plugin better than the WordPress (4.8+) native widget:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full featured TinyMCE Visual Editor (the same you have for pages and posts)<\/li>\n<li>Wide text area for an enhanced editing experience<\/li>\n<li>Compatible with 3rd party TinyMCE customization plugins (TinyMCE Advanced, WP Edit, &#8230;)<\/li>\n<li>Support for distraction-free (fullscreen) editing mode <\/li>\n<li>Option to &#8220;Automatically add paragraphs&#8221;

The AMP plugin is not serving as a mobile theme; it does not redirect mobile devices to the AMP version. Instead, the AMP version is served to mobile visitors when they find the content on platforms such as Twitter, Pinterest, Google Search, and others. Reader mode only supports serving AMP for singular posts, pages, and other post types, whereas Standard and Transitional mode support serving the entire site as AMP.<\/p>\n<p>With the official AMP plugin for WordPress, the WordPress ecosystem is provided with the capabilities and tools it needs to build world-class AMP experiences without deviating from its standard, flexible, and well-known content creation workflow.<\/p>\n<h3>Getting Started<\/h3>\n<p>To learn more about the plugin and start leveraging its capabilities to power your AMP content creation workflow check <a href=\"https:\/\/amp-wp.org\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">the official AMP plugin product site<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you are a developer, we encourage you to <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ampproject\/amp-wp\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">follow along<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/ampproject\/amp-wp\/blob\/develop\/contributing.md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">contribute<\/a> to the development of this plugin on GitHub.<\/p>\n","short_description":"Official AMP plugin, supported by the AMP team.

No more deleting, renaming and re-uploading files!<br \/>\nSupported by the friendly team that created <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/shortpixel-image-optimiser\/\">ShortPixel<\/a>  \ud83d\ude42<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>A real timesaver<\/h4>\n<p>Don&#8217;t you find it tedious and complicated to have to first delete a file and then upload one with the exact same name every time you want to update an image or any uploaded file inside the WordPress media library?<\/p>\n<p>Well, no longer!<\/p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;ll be able to replace any uploaded file from the media &#8220;edit&#8221; view, where it should be. Media replacement can be done in one of two ways:<\/p>\n<h4>It&#8217;s simple to replace a file<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Just replace the file. This option requires you to upload a file of the same type as the one you are replacing. The name of the attachment will stay the same no matter what the file you upload is called.<\/li>\n<li>Replace the file, use new file name and update all links. If you check this option, the name and type of the file you are about to upload will replace the old file. All links pointing to the current file will be updated to point to the new file name.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This plugin is very powerful and a must-have for any larger sites built with WordPress. It now also comes with preview of the replaced image!<\/p>\n<h4>Display file modification time<\/h4>\n<p>There is a shortcode available which picks up the file modification date and displays it in a post or a page. The code is:<br \/>\n    [file_modified id=XX format=XXXX] where the &#8220;id&#8221; is required and the &#8220;format&#8221; is optional and defaults to your current WordPress settings for date and time format.<\/p>\n<p>So <code>[file_modified id=870]<\/code> would display the last time the file with ID 870 was updated on your site. To get the ID for a file, check the URL when editing a file in the media library (see screenshot #4)<\/p>\n<p>If you want more control over the format used to display the time, you can use the format option, so <code>[file_modified id=870 format=Y-m-d]<\/code> would display the file modification date but not the time. The format string uses <a href=\"http:\/\/php.net\/manual\/en\/function.date.php\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">standard PHP date() formatting tags<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Compatible and recommended Plugins =<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/shortpixel-image-optimiser\/\">ShortPixel Image Optimization<\/a> &#8211; Enable Media Replace is fully compatible with this plugin.

Leaving it disabled ensures the frontend script is not enqueued and the unnecessary settings stay hidden.<\/p>\n<p><strong>For advanced use:<\/strong> Enable the &#8220;Advanced Mode&#8221; under Settings &gt; SVG Support.<\/p>\n<p>With advanced mode enabled, you can embed your SVG images just like you would a standard image with the addition of adding (in text view) the class <code>\"style-svg\"<\/code> (or the custom class you defined) to your IMG tags that you want this plugin to swap out with your actual SVG code.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;img class=\"style-svg\" alt=\"alt-text\" src=\"image-source.svg\" \/&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>or<\/p>\n<pre><code>&lt;img class=\"your-custom-class\" alt=\"alt-text\" src=\"image-source.svg\" \/&gt;\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<p>The whole IMG tag element will now be dynamically replaced by the actual code of your SVG, making the inner content targetable.<br \/>\nThis allows you to target elements within your SVG using CSS and JS.<\/p>\n<p>You can remove all other attributes from the IMG tag as it will disappear anyway.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a setting to automatically add your class to the IMG tag for you when you&#8217;re inserting SVG\u2019s in to a post or page, which also removes unnecessary tags.<br \/>\nSince 2.3.11, you can force all SVG files to be rendered inline with a single checkbox. Additionally, you can now choose whether to use the minified or expanded version of the JS file.<\/p>\n<p><em>Featured Images:<\/em> If a post\/page is saved with your SVG as a featured image, a checkbox will display in the featured image meta box to allow you to render it inline (only if advanced mode is active).<\/p>\n<p>Please Note: If your SVG isn\u2019t showing, it\u2019s likely that it is being displayed with 0 height and width. In this case, you will need to set your own height and width in your CSS for SVG files to display correctly.<\/p>\n<p><em>If you&#8217;re having any issues, please use the support tab and I will try my best to get back to you quickly<\/em><\/p>\n<h3>Security<\/h3>\n<p>As with allowing uploads of any files, there is potential risks involved. Only allow users to upload SVG files if you trust them. You have the option to restrict SVG usage to Administrators only from the settings page. By default, anyone with Media Library access or upload_files capability will be able to upload SVG files (that is Administrators, Authors and Editors). Please note that SVG files are actually XML which would allow someone to inject malicious code if you&#8217;re not careful with who has upload privileges.<\/p>\n<h3>Feedback<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>I&#8217;m open to your <a href=\"mailto:&#x77;&#112;&#064;&#x62;&#x65;&#110;b&#x6f;&#100;&#104;&#x69;&#x2e;&#099;&#111;&#x6d;\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">suggestions and feedback<\/a> &#8211; Thanks for using SVG Support!<\/li>\n<li>Tag me <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/benbodhi\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">@benbodhi<\/a> on Twitter #svgsupport<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>Note:<\/em> I hope you like this plugin!

More than just a table of contents plugin, this plugin can also output a sitemap listing pages and\/or categories across your entire site.<\/p>\n<p>Built from the ground up and with Wikipedia in mind, the table of contents by default appears before the first heading on a page.  This allows the author to insert lead-in content that may summarise or introduce the rest of the page.  It also uses a unique numbering scheme that doesn&#8217;t get lost through CSS differences across themes.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is a great companion for content rich sites such as content management system oriented configurations.  That said, bloggers also have the same benefits when writing long structured articles.  <a href=\"http:\/\/dublue.com\/2012\/05\/12\/another-benefit-to-structure-your-web-pages\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Discover how Google<\/a> uses this index to provide &#8216;Jump To&#8217; links to your content.<\/p>\n<p>Includes an administration options panel where you can customise settings like display position, define the minimum number of headings before an index is displayed, other appearance, and more.  For power users, expand the advanced options to further tweak its behaviour &#8211; eg: exclude undesired heading levels like h5 and h6 from being included; disable the output of the included CSS file; adjust the top offset and more.  Using shortcodes, you can override default behaviour such as special exclusions on a specific page or even to hide the table of contents altogether.<\/p>\n<p>Prefer to include the index in the sidebar?  Go to Appearance &gt; Widgets and drag the TOC+ to your desired sidebar and position.<\/p>\n<p>Custom post types are supported, however, auto insertion works only when the_content() has been used by the custom post type.  Each post type will appear in the options panel, so enable the ones you want.<\/p>\n<p>Collaborate, participate, fork this plugin on <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/zedzedzed\/table-of-contents-plus\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Github<\/a>.  Reach out on Github or place them at <a href=\"http:\/\/dublue.com\/plugins\/toc\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">http:\/\/dublue.com\/plugins\/toc\/<\/a><\/p>\n<h3>Shortcodes<\/h3>\n<p>The plugin was designed to be as seamless and painfree as possible and did not require you to insert a shortcode for operation.  However, using the shortcode allows you to fully control the position of the table of contents within your page.  The following shortcodes are available with this plugin.<\/p>\n<p>When attributes are left out for the shortcodes below, they will fallback to the settings you defined under Settings &gt; TOC+.  The following are detailed in the help tab.<\/p>\n<h4>[toc]<\/h4>\n<p>Lets you generate the table of contents at the preferred position.  Useful for sites that only require a TOC on a small handful of pages.  Supports the following attributes:<br \/>\n* &#8220;label&#8221;: text, title of the table of contents<br \/>\n* &#8220;no_label&#8221;: true\/false, shows or hides the title<br \/>\n* &#8220;wrapping&#8221;: text, either &#8220;left&#8221; or &#8220;right&#8221;<br \/>\n* &#8220;heading_levels&#8221;: numbers, this lets you select the heading levels you want included in the table of contents.  Separate multiple levels with a comma.  Example: include headings 3, 4 and 5 but exclude the others with <code>heading_levels=\"3,4,5\"<\/code><br \/>\n* &#8220;class&#8221;: text, enter CSS classes to be added to the container. Separate multiple classes with a space.<\/p>\n<h4>[no_toc]<\/h4>\n<p>Allows you to disable the table of contents for the current post, page, or custom post type.<\/p>\n<h4>[sitemap]<\/h4>\n<p>Produces a listing of all pages and categories for your site. You can use this on any post, page or even in a text widget.  Note that this will not include an index of posts so use sitemap_posts if you need this listing.<\/p>\n<h4>[sitemap_pages]<\/h4>\n<p>Lets you print out a listing of only pages. The following attributes are accepted:<br \/>\n* &#8220;heading&#8221;: number between 1 and 6, defines which html heading to use<br \/>\n* &#8220;label&#8221;: text, title of the list<br \/>\n* &#8220;no_label&#8221;: true\/false, shows or hides the list heading<br \/>\n* &#8220;exclude&#8221;: IDs of the pages or categories you wish to exclude<br \/>\n* &#8220;exclude_tree&#8221;: ID of the page or category you wish to exclude including its all descendants<\/p>\n<h4>[sitemap_categories]<\/h4>\n<p>Same as <code>[sitemap_pages]<\/code> but for categories.<\/p>\n<h4>[sitemap_posts]<\/h4>\n<p>This lets you print out an index of all published posts on your site.  By default, posts are listed in alphabetical order grouped by their first letters.  The following attributes are accepted:<br \/>\n* &#8220;order&#8221;: text, either ASC or DESC<br \/>\n* &#8220;orderby&#8221;: text, popular options include &#8220;title&#8221;, &#8220;date&#8221;, &#8220;ID&#8221;, and &#8220;rand&#8221;. See <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Class_Reference\/WP_Query#Order_.26_Orderby_Parameters\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP_Query<\/a> for a list.<br \/>\n* &#8220;separate&#8221;: true\/false (defaults to true), does not separate the lists by first letter when set to false.<br \/>\nUse the following CSS classes to customise the appearance of your listing:<br \/>\n* toc_sitemap_posts_section<br \/>\n* toc_sitemap_posts_letter<br \/>\n* toc_sitemap_posts_list<\/p>\n<h3>I love it, how can I show my appreciation?<\/h3>\n<p>If you have been impressed with this plugin and would like to somehow show some appreciation, rather than send a donation my way, please donate to your charity of choice.<\/p>\n<p>I will never ask for any form of reward or compensation.

Disable such options or exclude links manually with a class if possible (see instructions for SlimStat below)<\/li>\n<li>Most plugins and themes that already include a light box script. Continue reading to see if you are using one of the know ones or follow the troubleshooting steps to find out what is conflicting on your site.<\/li>\n<li>Any theme that is missing the obligatory <code>&lt;?php wp_footer(); ?&gt;<\/code> call in the footer.php template.<\/li>\n<li>When showing an iframe as inline content in FancyBox &#8212; not advised, use fancybox-iframe instead! &#8212; the iframe will become blank after opening and closing it. The solution is to link directly to the iframe source and use <code>class=\"fancybox-iframe\"<\/code> instead.<\/li>\n<li>Embedded flash content that has no wmode or wmode &#8216;window&#8217;, is displayed above the overlay and other javascript rendered content like dropdown menus. WordPress does NOT check for missing wmode in oEmbed generated embed code. Since version 1.3.4.5, the missing wmode is added by this plugin for WP (auto-)embeds but not for other user-embedded content. Please make sure you set the wmode parameter to &#8216;opaque&#8217; (best performance) or &#8216;transparent&#8217; (only when you need transparency) for your embedded content.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Plugin conflicts<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>jQuery Updater<\/strong> moves jQuery to version 2+ which is incompatible.<\/li>\n<li><strong>WP Slimstat<\/strong> and <strong>Matomo\/Piwik<\/strong> with Track Outbound Clicks enabled, will break the light box effect on some browsers. Adding <code>fancybox<\/code> (or any of the other classes like <code>fancybox-youtube,fancybox-iframe,fancybox-inline<\/code> depending on which media should be displayed in FancyBox) to the Do Not Track field is reported to solve the issue. Slimstat also might interfere with the YouTube url conversion. When clicking a Youtube link, the movie opens in an overlay as it is supposed to but immediately after that, the complete page gets redirected to the original YouTube page. Adding a <code>class=\"noslimstat\"<\/code> to the link is reported to work around the issue.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Google Analytics for WordPress<\/strong> converts links like <code>href=\"#anyID\"<\/code> to <code>href=\"http:\/\/yoursite.url\/page\/#anyID\"<\/code>, disabling inline content shown in FancyBox.<\/li>\n<li>Both the <strong>uBillBoard<\/strong> and <strong>Camera slideshow<\/strong> have their own easing script hard-coded which conflicts with the one in Easy FancyBox. The only way around the conflict is to set both the Easing In and Easing Out options on your Settings &gt; Media page to <strong>Swing<\/strong>.<\/li>\n<li><strong>WordPress Firewall 2<\/strong> blocks access to image files needed for proper display of the FancyBox overlay in older IE and other non-css3 browsers.<\/li>\n<li><strong>WordPress Amazon Associate<\/strong>: A script provided by Amazon and the FancyBox script are incompatible. Disabling <em>Product Preview<\/em> in the <strong>WP &#8211; Amazon &gt; Settings<\/strong> page should work around the issue.<\/li>\n<li><strong>WP Supersized<\/strong> uses the Animate Enhanced jQuery extension which causes a conflict with the Easing extension used by FancyBox resulting in a 0px sized lightbox frame and\/or some kind of positioning issue with auto-centering.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Theme conflicts<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Older versions of <strong>Elegant Themes<\/strong> have FancyBox integrated in a hard-coded way, making them incompatible with Easy FancyBox. In the latest versions of these themes, there is an option to disable the included FancyBox. Use this option to make your theme compatible with Easy FancyBox \ud83d\ude42<\/li>\n<li>The <strong>Mystique<\/strong> theme has two options called &#8220;Lightbox&#8221; and &#8220;Optimize website for faster loading&#8221; that will break Easy FancyBox. Disable both in Mystique&#8217;s options &gt; Advanced.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Imbalance<\/strong> and other themes that uses the Photo Galleria jQuery extension: turn of the JSGallery option.<\/li>\n<li>Themes like <strong>Envisioned<\/strong>, <strong>Chameleon<\/strong> and many others have FancyBox baked in. There is no solution other than stripping the theme of all FancyBox related code or better: disable the plugin and use the theme provided version&#8230;<\/li>\n<li>Themes based on the <strong>Thesis<\/strong> framework might see issues in IE 8, for which <a href=\"https:\/\/voidzonemedia.com\/solutions\/thesis-ie8-remove-ie7-emulation\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">a hack has been proposed<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","short_description":"Easily enable the FancyBox jQuery extension on just about all media links.

We believe that WordPress database migration doesn&#8217;t have to be overly technical or opaque. Instead, WP Migrate DB was created with the sole aim of making WordPress site migration easy.<\/p>\n<p>WP Migrate DB fully supports serialized data and arrays and can find and replace content within serialized arrays. What does this mean for you? It means it&#8217;s far easier to migrate your database, and there&#8217;s no risk of data corruption.<\/p>\n<p>WP Migrate DB  handles serialized data by unserializing the data and going through it, identifying strings and running a find &amp; replace on them. Once it has gone through all the data, it serializes it again and sticks it back in the database.<\/p>\n<p>Example: <code>s:5:\"hello\"<\/code> becomes <code>s:11:\"hello world\"<\/code><\/p>\n<p>You&#8217;re also able to run in-place find and replace, which lets you find and replace on the current database (without migration).<\/p>\n<h3>Testimonials &#8211; WordPress Experts Love Us<\/h3>\n<p>We&#8217;ve made an impact since launching the first version of WP Migrate DB with over 300,000 active installs, and hundreds of 5* reviews on WordPress.org.

Child Theme Configurator lets you search styles by CSS selector and by property. If you wish to customize a specific CSS selector (e.g., h1), use the &#8220;Query\/Selector&#8221; tab. If you have a specific CSS value you wish to customize site-wide (e.g., the color of the type), use the &#8220;Property\/Value&#8221; tab.<\/p>\n<p>The Query\/Selector tab lets you find specific CSS selectors and edit them. First, find the query that contains the CSS selector you wish to edit by typing in the Query autoselect box. Select by clicking with the mouse or by pressing the &#8220;Enter&#8221; or &#8220;Tab&#8221; keys. CSS selectors are in the base query by default.<br \/>\nNext, find the CSS selector by typing in the &#8220;Selector&#8221; autoselect box. Select by clicking with the mouse or by pressing the &#8220;Enter&#8221; or &#8220;Tab&#8221; keys.<\/p>\n<p>This will load all of the properties for that CSS selector with the Original values on the left and the child theme values inputs on the right. Any existing child theme values will be automatically populated. There is also a Sample preview that displays the combination of Parent and Child overrides. Note that the border and background-image get special treatment.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;Order&#8221; field contains the original sequence of the CSS selector in the parent theme stylesheet. You can change the CSS selector order sequence by entering a lower or higher number in the &#8220;Order&#8221; field. You can also force style overrides (so called &#8220;!important&#8221; flag) by checking the &#8220;!&#8221; box next to each input. Please use judiciously.<\/p>\n<p>Click &#8220;Save&#8221; to update the child theme stylesheet and save your changes to the WordPress admin.<\/p>\n<h3>Adding Raw CSS<\/h3>\n<p>If you wish to add additional properties to a given CSS selector, first load the selector using the Query\/Selector tab. Then find the property you wish to override by typing in the New Property autoselect box. Select by clicking with the mouse or by pressing the &#8220;Enter&#8221; or &#8220;Tab&#8221; keys. This will add a new input row to the selector inputs.<\/p>\n<p>If you wish to add completely new CSS selectors, or even new @media queries, you can enter free-form CSS in the &#8220;Raw CSS&#8221; textarea. Be aware that your syntax must be correct (i.e., balanced curly braces, etc.) for the parser to load the new custom styles. You will know it is invalid because a red &#8220;X&#8221; will appear next to the save button.<\/p>\n<p>If you prefer to use shorthand syntax for properties and values instead of the inputs provided by Child Theme Configurator, you can enter them here as well. The parser will convert your input into normalized CSS code automatically.<\/p>\n<h3>Property\/Value Tab<\/h3>\n<p>The Property\/Value tab lets you find specific values for a given property and then edit that value for individual CSS selectors that use that property\/value combination. First, find the property you wish to override by typing in the Property autoselect box. Select by clicking with the mouse or by pressing the &#8220;Enter&#8221; or &#8220;Tab&#8221; keys.<\/p>\n<p>This will load all of the unique values that exist for that property in the parent theme stylesheet with a Sample preview for that value. If there are values that exist in the child theme stylesheet that do not exist in the parent stylesheet, they will be displayed as well.<\/p>\n<p>For each unique value, click the &#8220;Selectors&#8221; link to view a list of CSS selectors that use that property\/value combination, grouped by query with a Sample preview of the value and inputs for the child theme value. Any existing child theme values will be automatically populated.<\/p>\n<p>Click &#8220;Save&#8221; to update the child theme stylesheet and save your changes to the WordPress admin.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to edit all of the properties for the CSS selector you can click the \u201cEdit\u201d link and the CSS selector will automatically load in the Query\/Selector Tab.<\/p>\n<h3>Web Fonts Tab<\/h3>\n<p>You can add additional stylesheets and web fonts by typing @import rules into the textarea on the Web Fonts tab. <strong>Important: do not import the parent theme stylesheet here.<\/strong> Use the &#8220;Parent stylesheet handling&#8221; option from the Parent\/Child tab.<\/p>\n<h3>Files Tab<\/h3>\n<h4>Parent Templates<\/h4>\n<p>You can copy PHP template files from the parent theme by checking the boxes. Click &#8220;Copy Selected to Child Theme&#8221; and the templates will be added to the child theme&#8217;s directory.<\/p>\n<p>CAUTION: If your child theme is active, the child theme&#8217;s version of the file will be used instead of the parent immediately after it is copied. The functions.php file is generated separately and cannot be copied here.<\/p>\n<h4>Child Theme Files<\/h4>\n<p>Templates copied from the parent are listed here. These can be edited using the Theme Editor in the Appearance Menu. Remove child theme images by checking the boxes and clicking &#8220;Delete Selected.&#8221;<\/p>\n<h4>Child Theme Images<\/h4>\n<p>Theme images reside under the <code>images<\/code> directory in your child theme and are meant for stylesheet use only. Use the media gallery for content images. You can upload new images using the image upload form.<\/p>\n<h4>Child Theme Screenshot<\/h4>\n<p>You can upload a custom screenshot for the child theme here. The theme screenshot should be a 4:3 ratio (eg., 880px x 660px) JPG, PNG or GIF. It will be renamed &#8220;screenshot&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h4>Export Child Theme as Zip Archive<\/h4>\n<p>You can download your child theme for use on another WordPress site by clicking &#8220;Export&#8221;.<\/p>\n<h3>Preview and Activate<\/h3>\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT: Test child themes before activating!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some themes (particularly commercial themes) do not correctly load parent template files or automatically load child theme stylesheets or php files.<\/p>\n<p><strong>In the worst cases they will break your website when you activate the child theme.<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Navigate to Appearance &gt; Themes in the WordPress Admin.

Go to &#8220;Themes&#8221; in the Network Admin.<\/p>\n<h3>Caveats<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Arbitrary comments are not supported. Providing a high level of flexibility for previewing and modifying custom styles requires a sophisticated parsing system. Maintaining comments that are bound to any particular element in the stylesheet is prohibitively expensive compared to the value it would add. Although we are working to include this as an option in the future, currently all comments are stripped from the child theme stylesheet code.<\/li>\n<li>No @keyframes or @font-face rules. Child Theme Configurator only supports @media and @import. If you need other @rules, put them in a separate stylesheet and import them into the Child Theme stylesheet.<\/li>\n<li>Only two-color gradients. Child Theme Configurator is powerful, but we have simplified the gradient interface. You can use any gradient you want as long as it has two colors and no intermediate stops.<\/li>\n<li>CSS properties are auto-discovered. Child Theme Configurator loads the properties that exist in the Parent stylesheet. You can always add new properties using the \u201cRaw CSS\u201d text area.<\/li>\n<li>Legacy gradient syntax is not supported. Child Theme Configurator does not support the MS filter gradient or legacy webkit gradient. These will continue to work if they are used in the parent theme, but will not be written to the child theme stylesheet. If there is a demand, we may add it in a future release, but most users should have upgraded by now.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Documentation<\/h3>\n<p>Go to http:\/\/www.childthemeconfigurator.com\/<\/p>\n<p>Serbo-Croatian translation courtesy of Borisa Djuraskovic borisad@webhostinghub.com http:\/\/www.webhostinghub.com<\/p>\n<p>Copyright: (C) 2014-2018 Lilaea Media<\/p>\n","short_description":"When using the Customizer is not enough - Create a child theme from your installed themes and customize styles, templates, functions and more.","download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/child-theme-configurator.2.5.5.zip","tags":{"child":"child","child-theme":"child theme","child-themes":"child themes","custom-styles":"custom-styles","theme":"theme"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=8QE5YJ8WE96AJ","icons":{"1x":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/child-theme-configurator\/assets\/icon-128x128.png?rev=1557885"}},{"name":"Image Widget","slug":"image-widget","version":"4.4.7","author":"<a href=\"http:\/\/m.tri.be\/iwpdoc\">Modern Tribe, Inc.<\/a>","author_profile":"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/peterchester","requires":"3.5","tested":"5.2.7","requires_php":false,"rating":98,"ratings":{"5":264,"4":15,"3":2,"2":2,"1":4},"num_ratings":287,"support_threads":1,"support_threads_resolved":0,"active_installs":300000,"downloaded":4019115,"last_updated":"2019-06-12 9:14pm GMT","added":"2008-07-26","homepage":"http:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/image-widget\/","description":"<p>Image Widget is a simple plugin that uses the native WordPress media manager to add image widgets to your site.<\/p>\n<p>Need to add slideshows, lightboxes, or random images?<br \/>\n<strong>Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/m.tri.be\/19mc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Image Widget Plus<\/a>!<\/strong><\/p>\n<h4>Image Widget Features<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Responsive<\/li>\n<li>MU Compatible<\/li>\n<li>Handles image resizing and alignment<\/li>\n<li>Link the image<\/li>\n<li>Add title and description<\/li>\n<li>Versatile &#8211; all fields are optional<\/li>\n<li>Upload, link to external image, or select an image from your media collection<\/li>\n<li>Customize the look &amp; feel with filter hooks or theme overrides<\/li>\n<li>Additional features available with <a href=\"http:\/\/m.tri.be\/19mc\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Image Widget Plus<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Quality You Can Trust<\/h4>\n<p>Image Widget is developed and maintained by <a href=\"http:\/\/m.tri.be\/19md\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Modern Tribe<\/a>, the same folks behind <a href=\"http:\/\/m.tri.be\/19me\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">The Events Calendar, Event Tickets, and a full suite of premium plugins<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This plugin is actively supported by our team and contributions from community members.

If you would like to alter the widget display code, create a new folder called &#8220;image-widget&#8221; in your template directory and copy over the &#8220;views\/widget.php&#8221; file.<\/p>\n<p>Edit the new file to your hearts content. Please do not edit the one in the plugin folder as that will cause conflicts when you update the plugin to the latest release.<\/p>\n<p>New in 3.2: You may now also use the &#8220;sp_template_image-widget_widget.php&#8221; filter to override the default template behavior for .php template files. Eg: if you wanted widget.php to reside in a folder called my-custom-templates\/ and wanted it to be called my-custom-name.php:<\/p>\n<pre><code>add_filter('sp_template_image-widget_widget.php', 'my_template_filter');\nfunction my_template_filter($template) {\n    return get_template_directory() . '\/my-custom-templates\/my-custom-name.php';\n}\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h4>Filters<\/h4>\n<p>There are a number of filters in the code that will allow you to override data as you see fit. The best way to learn what filters are available is always by simply searching the code for &#8216;apply_filters&#8217;. But all the same, here are a few of the more essential filters:<\/p>\n<p><em>widget_title<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is actually a pretty typical filter in widgets and is applied to the widget title.<\/p>\n<p><em>widget_text<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Another very typical widget filter that is applied to the description body text. This filter also takes 2 additional arguments for $args and $instance so that you can learn more about the specific widget instance in the process of filtering the content.<\/p>\n<p><em>image_widget_image_attachment_id<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Filters the attachment id of the image.<br \/>\nAccepts additional $args and $instance arguments.<\/p>\n<p><em>image_widget_image_url<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Filters the url of the image displayed in the widget.<br \/>\nAccepts additional $args and $instance arguments.<br \/>\nTHIS IS DEPRECATED AND WILL EVENTUALLY BE DELETED<\/p>\n<p><em>image_widget_image_width<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Filters the display width of the image.<br \/>\nAccepts additional $args and $instance arguments.<\/p>\n<p><em>image_widget_image_height<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Filters the display height of the image.<br \/>\nAccepts additional $args and $instance arguments.<\/p>\n<p><em>image_widget_image_maxwidth<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Filters the inline max-width style of the image.

Snippets can can be activated and deactivated, just like plugins. The snippet editor includes fields for a name, a visual editor-enabled description, tags to allow you to categorize snippets, and a full-featured code editor. Snippets can be exported for transfer to another side, either in JSON for later importing by the Code Snippets plugin, or in PHP for creating your own plugin or theme.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any feedback, issues, or suggestions for improvements please leave a topic in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/plugin\/code-snippets\">Support Forum<\/a>, or <a href=\"https:\/\/facebook.com\/groups\/codesnippetsplugin\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">join the community on Facebook<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you like this plugin, or it is useful to you in some way, please consider reviewing it on <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/view\/plugin-reviews\/code-snippets\">WordPress.org<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to contribute to the plugin&#8217;s code or translate it into another language, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sheabunge\/code-snippets\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">fork the plugin on GitHub<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Translations<\/h4>\n<p>Code Snippets can be used in these different languages thanks to the following translators:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Danish &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/finnsommer\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Finn Sommer Jensen<\/a><\/li>\n<li>French \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/www.momofr.net\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">momo-fr<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/sheabunge.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Shea Bunge<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Belarusian &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hrank.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Hrank.com<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Brazilian Portuguese \u2013 <a href=\"http:\/\/brunoborges.info\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Bruno Borges<\/a><\/li>\n<li>French (Canada) &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dominicdesbiens.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Dominic Desbiens<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Indonesian &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chameleonjohn.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jordan Silaen from ChameleonJohn.com<\/a><\/li>\n<li>German &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/web-alltag.de\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Mario Siegmann<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sensorgrafie.de\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Joerg Knoerchen<\/a>, and <a href=\"http:\/\/deckerweb.de\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">David Decker<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Dutch &#8211; <a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sander1\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Sander Spies<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Slovak &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/wp.sk\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">J\u00e1n Faj\u010d\u00e1k<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Russian &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordpressplugins.ru\/administration\/code-snippets.html\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Alexander Samsonov<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Chinese &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/shanjincheng.com\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Jincheng Shan<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Croatian &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webhostinghub.com\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Borisa Djuraskovic from Web Hosting Hub<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Japanese &#8211; <a href=\"http:\/\/mt8.biz\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">mt8<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","short_description":"An easy, clean and simple way to run code snippets on your site.","download_link":"https:\/\/downloads.wordpress.org\/plugin\/code-snippets.zip","tags":{"code":"code","code-snippets":"code-snippets","network":"network","php":"php","snippets":"snippets"},"donate_link":"https:\/\/sheabunge.com\/donate","icons":{"1x":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/code-snippets\/assets\/icon.svg?rev=2148878","svg":"https:\/\/ps.w.org\/code-snippets\/assets\/icon.svg?rev=2148878"}},{"name":"Responsive Lightbox &amp; Gallery","slug":"responsive-lightbox","version":"2.2.3.1","author":"<a href=\"http:\/\/www.dfactory.eu\/\">dFactory<\/a>","author_profile":"https:\/\/profiles.wordpress.org\/dfactory","requires":"4.0","tested":"5.4.2","requires_php":"5.2.4","rating":98,"ratings":{"5":1609,"4":37,"3":9,"2":10,"1":26},"num_ratings":1691,"support_threads":12,"support_threads_resolved":1,"active_installs":300000,"downloaded":3528175,"last_updated":"2020-05-29 7:18am GMT","added":"2013-07-08","homepage":"http:\/\/www.dfactory.eu\/plugins\/responsive-lightbox\/","description":"<h4>Everything You Need in a WordPress Gallery Plugin<\/h4>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/dfactory.eu\/products\/responsive-lightbox\/?utm_source=repo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=responsive-lightbox-plugin-free\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Responsive Lightbox and Gallery plugin<\/a> is a fully fledged WordPress gallery plugin with a powerful Drag &amp; Drop Gallery Builder and Lightbox functionality that&#8217;s used daily by more than 300,000 active users and downloaded over 3 Million times.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of it is how easy it is for you to customize it and enhance its features thanks to <a href=\"?utm_source=repo&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=responsive-lightbox-plugin-free\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">free and premium extensions<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Why You Should Use Responsive Lightbox and Gallery Plugin<\/h4>\n<h4>Easiest Gallery Builder<\/h4>\n<p>Say goodbye to coding.

And just like physical blocks, WordPress blocks can added, arranged, and rearranged, allowing WordPress users to create media-rich pages in a visually intuitive way &#8212; and without work-arounds like shortcodes or custom HTML.<\/p>\n<p>The block editor first became available in December 2018, and we&#8217;re still hard at work refining the experience, creating more and better blocks, and laying the groundwork for the next three phases of work. The Gutenberg plugin gives you the latest version of the block editor so you can join us in testing bleeding-edge features, start playing with blocks, and maybe get inspired to build your own.<\/p>\n<h3>Discover More<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>User Documentation:<\/strong> See the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/support\/article\/wordpress-editor\/\">WordPress Editor documentation<\/a> for detailed docs on using the editor as an author creating posts and pages.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Developer Documentation:<\/strong> Extending and customizing is at the heart of the WordPress platform, see the <a href=\"https:\/\/developer.wordpress.org\/block-editor\/developers\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Developer Documentation<\/a> for extensive tutorials, documentation, and API reference on how to extend the editor.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Contributors:<\/strong> Gutenberg is an open-source project and welcomes all contributors from code to design, from documentation to triage.

The text field lets you use WP&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Conditional_Tags\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Conditional Tags<\/a>, or any general PHP code.<\/p>\n<p>PLEASE NOTE The widget logic you introduce is EVAL&#8217;d directly. Anyone who has access to edit widget appearance will have the right to add any code, including malicious and possibly destructive functions. There is an optional filter &#8216;widget_logic_eval_override&#8217; which you can use to bypass the EVAL with your own code if needed. (See <a href=\"other_notes\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Other Notes<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p>The configuring and options are in the usual widget admin interface.<\/p>\n<h4>Configuration<\/h4>\n<p>Aside from logic against your widgets, there are three options added to the foot of the widget admin page (see screenshots).<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Use &#8216;wp_reset_query&#8217; fix &#8212; Many features of WP, as well as the many themes and plugins out there, can mess with the conditional tags, such that is_home is NOT true on the home page. This can often be fixed with a quick wp_reset_query() statement just before the widgets are called, and this option puts that in for you rather than having to resort to code editing<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Load logic &#8212; This option allows you to set the point in the page load at which your widget logic if first checked. Pre v.50 it was when the &#8216;wp_head&#8217; trigger happened, ie during the creation of the HTML&#8217;s HEAD block. Many themes didn&#8217;t call wp_head, which was a problem. From v.50 it happens, by default, as early as possible, which is as soon as the plugin loads. You can now specify these &#8216;late load&#8217; points (in chronological order):<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>after the theme loads (after_setup_theme trigger)<\/li>\n<li>when all PHP loaded (wp_loaded trigger)<\/li>\n<li>after query variables set (parse_query) \u2013 this is the default<\/li>\n<li>during page header (wp_head trigger)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You may need to delay the load if your logic depends on functions defined, eg in the theme functions.php file. Conversely you may want the load early so that the widget count is calculated correctly, eg to show an alternative layour or content when a sidebar has no widgets.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p>Don&#8217;t cache widget logic results &#8212; From v .58 the widget logic code should only execute once, but that might cause unexpected results with some themes, so this option is here to turn that behaviour off. (The truth\/false of the code will be evaluated every time the sidebars_widgets filter is called.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Writing Logic Code<\/h3>\n<p>The text in the &#8216;Widget logic&#8217; field can be full PHP code and should return &#8216;true&#8217; when you need the widget to appear. If there is no &#8216;return&#8217; in the text, an implicit &#8216;return&#8217; is added to the start and a &#8216;;&#8217; is added on the end. (This is just to make single statements like is_home() more convenient.)<\/p>\n<h4>The Basics<\/h4>\n<p>Make good use of <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Conditional_Tags\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">WP&#8217;s own conditional tags<\/a>. You can vary and combine code using:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>!<\/code> (NOT) to <strong>reverse<\/strong> the logic, eg <code>!is_home()<\/code> is TRUE when this is NOT the home page.<\/li>\n<li><code>||<\/code> (OR) to <strong>combine<\/strong> conditions. <code>X OR Y<\/code> is TRUE when either X is true or Y is true.<\/li>\n<li><code>&amp;&amp;<\/code> (AND) to make conditions <strong>more specific<\/strong>. <code>X AND Y<\/code> is TRUE when both X is true and Y is true.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are lots of great code examples on the WP forums, and on WP sites across the net. But the WP Codex is also full of good examples to adapt, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Template_Tags\/in_category#Testing_if_a_post_is_in_a_descendant_category\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Test if post is in a descendent category<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Examples<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li><code>is_home()<\/code> &#8212; just the main blog page<\/li>\n<li><code>!is_page('about')<\/code> &#8212; everywhere EXCEPT this specific WP &#8216;page&#8217;<\/li>\n<li><code>!is_user_logged_in()<\/code> &#8212; shown when a user is not logged in<\/li>\n<li><code>is_category(array(5,9,10,11))<\/code> &#8212; category page of one of the given category IDs<\/li>\n<li><code>is_single() &amp;&amp; in_category('baked-goods')<\/code> &#8212; single post that&#8217;s in the category with this slug<\/li>\n<li><code>current_user_can('level_10')<\/code> &#8212; admin only widget<\/li>\n<li><code>strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_REFERER'], \"google.com\")!=false<\/code> &#8212; widget to show when clicked through from a google search<\/li>\n<li><code>is_category() &amp;&amp; in_array($cat, get_term_children( 5, 'category'))<\/code> &#8212; category page that&#8217;s a descendent of category 5<\/li>\n<li><code>global $post; return (in_array(77,get_post_ancestors($post)));<\/code> &#8212; WP page that is a child of page 77<\/li>\n<li><code>global $post; return (is_page('home') || ($post-&gt;post_parent==\"13\"));<\/code> &#8212; home page OR the page that&#8217;s a child of page 13<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note the extra &#8216;;&#8217; on the end where there is an explicit &#8216;return&#8217;.<\/p>\n<h3>The &#8216;widget_logic_eval_override&#8217; filter<\/h3>\n<p>Before the Widget Logic code is evaluated for each widget, the text of the Widget Logic code is passed through this filter.

Admins can activate\/deactivate every part of the menu and even parts of the sub-menu. Meta fields can be administered separately for posts and pages. Certain parts of the write menu can be deactivated separately for admins or non-admins. The header of the backend is minimized and optimized to give you more space and the structure of the menu gets changed to make it more logical &#8211; this can all be done per user so each role and their resulting users can have his own settings.<\/p>\n<h4>Support Custom Post Type<\/h4>\n<p>The plugin support all functions also for custom post types, automatically in the settings page.<\/p>\n<h4>Support Custom Options on all different post types<\/h4>\n<p>It is possible to add own options to hide areas in the back-end of WordPress.

Please be careful when using WP Reset with WP-CLI &#8211; as with using the GUI always make a snapshot or backup first.<\/p>\n<p>Currently supported WP-CLI commands:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>wp reset reset<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>wp reset version<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>wp reset delete<\/code><\/li>\n<li><code>wp reset snapshots<\/code><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Database Snapshots<\/h4>\n<p>Database snapshot is a copy of all WP database tables, standard and custom ones, saved in the currently used database (as set by <em>wp-config.php<\/em>). Files are not saved or included in snapshots in any way.<br \/>\nSnapshots are primarily a development tool. Although they can be used for backups (and downloaded as gzipped SQL dumps), we suggest finding a more suitable tool for doing backups of live sites. Use snapshots to find out what changes a plugin made to your database &#8211; what custom tables were created, modified, deleted or what changes were made to site&#8217;s settings. Or use it to quickly restore the development environment after testing database related changes.<br \/>\nRestoring a snapshot does not affect other snapshots, or WP Reset settings. Snapshots can be compared to current database tables, restored (by overwriting current tables), exported ad gzipped SQL dumps, or deleted. Creating a snapshot on an average WordPress installation takes 1-2 seconds.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xBfMmS12vMY?version=3&#038;rel=0&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span><\/p>\n<h4>Multisite (WP-MU) Support<\/h4>\n<p>WP Reset has yet to be completely tested with multisite!

Both the Gutenberg block selector and the Gutenberg classic block will show the YouTube wizard button. For the Gutenberg block selector, click on the (+) sign for the block editor list. The YouTube Wizard block is located under the &#8220;Embeds&#8221; category (make sure you choose &#8220;YouTube <strong>Wizard<\/strong>&#8220;).

For these and pretty much any other page builder with a short code widget, you can also embed your video, gallery, live stream, or premiere by creating the short code in the plugin&#8217;s wizard and then embedding the code in the page builder&#8217;s short code widget or text widget.<\/li>\n<li>Privacy and Consent &#8211; Improved privacy and GDPR compliance options like YouTube no cookie, YouTube API restrictions, and a customizable GDPR consent message<\/li>\n<li>YouTube gallery capability (channel and playlist) \u2013 The ability to make playlist and channel embeds have a gallery layout. By default, the plugin can generate a grid-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.embedplus.com\/responsive-youtube-playlist-channel-gallery-for-wordpress.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">responsive playlist or channel gallery &gt;&gt;<\/a>.

You can embed a direct link to a livestream too.<\/li>\n<li>YouTube Premieres &#8211; You can also embed premiere videos using the same method we created for live streams<\/li>\n<li>Simultaneous playback control &#8211; you can enable\/disable the ability for visitors to have separate videos running at the same time on the same page.

Adding these will override the above global defaults that you set:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>width &#8211; Sets the width of your player. If omitted, the default width will be the width of your theme&#8217;s content. Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;width=500&amp;height=350\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>height &#8211; Sets the height of your player.

Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;width=500&amp;height=350\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>autoplay &#8211; Set this to 1 to autoplay the video (or 0 to play the video once).

Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;iv_load_policy=3\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>loop &#8211; Set this to 1 to loop the video (or 0 to not loop). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;loop=1\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>modestbranding &#8211; Set this to 1 to remove the YouTube logo while playing (or 0 to show the logo). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;modestbranding=1\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>rel &#8211; Set this to 0 to only show related videos from the same channel as the current video (or 1 to show videos from any channel). Example: <code>\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=quwebVjAEJA&amp;rel=0\"<\/code><\/li>\n<li>showinfo &#8211; Set this to 0 to hide the video title and other info (or 1 to show it).

On top of that, it fully supports all custom post types that you have on your website or blog (portfolio, gallery, staff, testimonials, etc.).<\/p>\n<p>With a convenient and straightforward drag and drop sortable JavaScript, you can create the exact order of posts and pages that match your heart\u2019s content.<\/p>\n<p>You can do all the sorting and order straight from your WordPress administration. Worth noting, Simple Custom Post Order plugin does not require you to perform any configuration in advance. Just plug and play.<\/p>\n<p>When you disable the plugin, all sortings will fall back to the default one used by WordPress.

Reordering default posts, custom post types, pages, or taxonomy becomes a piece of cake with Simple Custom Post Order.<\/p>\n<p>It has never been easier to arrange and sort custom post types, pages, posts, gallery items, portfolio items, categories, tags, and any other post, content, or taxonomy type.<\/p>\n<p>Simple Custom Post Order features:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Arrange posts<\/li>\n<li>Arrange pages<\/li>\n<li>Arrange taxonomies such as categories or tags<\/li>\n<li>Arrange custom post types such as portfolio<\/li>\n<li>Arrange custom post taxonomies (categories or tags)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>LOCALIZATION<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Simple Custom Post Order is available in 10+ languages, like French, Spanish, Greek, Catalan and Albanian, to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>Would you like to make a contribution by translating the plugin to your language?

Also, they are the most customer-friendly approach to share a special message to your visitors, as they don&#8217;t interrupt your visitors while browsing or scanning your site. Thus, you will be able to easily draw their attention to sales, special offers and contests. If you decide to make use of targeted audience, you&#8217;d better consider those of a particular social network you get a lot of traffic from. Another thing you will be able to do is to grab email addresses by offering an incentive to subscribe.<\/p>\n<h4>Countdown Popup<\/h4>\n<p>You are lucky enough to come up with a great project, novelty or an unprecedented offer? You don&#8217;t know how to stress its importance and make people long for it? Well, there is at least one version and we are here to lighten up your burden. Imagine a time counter that is decreasing in days, hours, minutes, etc.. We suggest installing this countdown popup that helps to present your content and keep people anticipating for it, as the popup gives information and shows the time left for reaching it at the same time.<br \/>\nWhile building up the popup, you are able to attach any kind of media or textual material. Moreover, you can control its look by choosing the popup theme and the accompanying effect. The way the counter is displayed is also manageable, since you can choose the counter background colour, text colour and language, countdown format, time zone and the location of the counter in the popup.<br \/>\nIn the meantime, there are basic and advanced options available which help to regulate the dismissal, display, colour and location of the countdown popup. It can be chosen to turn up while scrolling or remain unchangeable, be closed automatically or manually. As far as the size of the popup is concerned, it can easily be arranged in the dimensions&#8217; options.<\/p>\n<h4>Subscription Popup<\/h4>\n<p>No doubt, building a trustful relationship with an audience is highly important if you wish to make a profit online and have an email list full of targeted, engaged subscribers. As the trust grows, the audience will be more prone to buying whatever is being sold. One way to make this happen is to make people wish to subscribe to your website with the help of the Subscription popup which can help to extend the functionality of your website.<br \/>\nThe Subscription popup offered allows to generate a great-looking form, add a compelling incentive to subscribe and guarantee the buildup of an email list, as, once installed, it will be given maximum visibility on your website.<br \/>\nHappily, almost every element of the popup is fully customizable &#8211; including fonts, sizes and colours, themes and effects applied. Also, you can view it real-time thanks to the live previewer displaying changes you make.<br \/>\nThe appearance and disappearance of the popup is under complete control too. It will appear after a pre-configured wait, be permanent or turn up while scrolling, close by hand or by itself.<\/p>\n<h4>Age restriction Popup<\/h4>\n<p>Internet is recognized as somehow an open space for creation and dissemination of ideas and content that comply to no kind of limits. It is also known that many children have at least once accessed some online content that contains violence, sex, bad language, etc.. The latter can play a crucial role in the child&#8217;s personality development and can lead to serious deviations later.<br \/>\nThus, to help avoid such kind of developments, you can foster child protection by simply deciding on how much explicit each of your content is and installing the age restriction popup we offer. It will make your content accessible to the age group it refers to, as the popup will make the user answer some questions to decide his\/her age and will direct to certain content accordingly.<br \/>\nThis popup can be built up to your preferences, as there is a range of options at hand. First, you can choose to put restriction on both visual and textual materials. Then, you will be able to see about the popup appearance by choosing the theme and effects to be adjusted to it, the background and text colour, radius of the &#8220;Yes&#8221; and &#8220;No&#8221; buttons below the question. Also, you can manage its dimensions and decide on its accessibility on different devices. Meanwhile, you are able to make it automatically closable, leave it open all the time or only while scrolling the page.<\/p>\n<p>More marketing popup descriptions\/solutions are coming soon.<\/p>\n<p>Popup Builder Team.<\/p>\n","short_description":"Discover whole new ball game of pop-ups.

Export Options<\/h4>\n<p>The Customizer Export\/Import plugin previously only exported options saved as theme mods using the <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Function_Reference\/get_theme_mods\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">get_theme_mods<\/a> function, but that is no more! The Customizer Export\/Import plugin now exports settings saved as options as well!<\/p>\n<h4>How It Works<\/h4>\n<p>Exporting customizer settings is easy. Click the export button from within the customizer and a file will automatically begin downloading with your settings. Export files are named after your theme and can only be used to import settings for the theme or child theme that they came from. Export files contain a serialized dump of mods retrieved using the <a href=\"https:\/\/codex.wordpress.org\/Function_Reference\/get_theme_mods\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">get_theme_mods<\/a> function or customizer settings saved as options.<\/p>\n<p>Importing customizer settings is just as easy. Choose the export file you would like to import, select whether you would like to download and import images (similar to importing posts), and finally, click the import button. Once your settings have been imported the page will refresh and your new design will be displayed.<\/p>\n<h4>Exporting Custom Options<\/h4>\n<p>Developers can also have arbitrary options that aren&#8217;t part of the customizer exported by using the cei_export_option_keys filter. Those options can be exported and imported by adding your option key to the array of options that will be exported as shown below.<\/p>\n<pre><code>function my_export_option_keys( $keys ) {\n    $keys[] = 'my_option_key';\n    $keys[] = 'another_option_key';\n    return $keys;\n}\n\nadd_filter( 'cei_export_option_keys', 'my_export_option_keys' );\n<\/code><\/pre>\n<h4>Known Issues<\/h4>\n<p>This plugin currently only works for active themes, not themes that are being previewed with either the Theme Test Drive plugin or the new customizer theme preview.<\/p>\n<h4>Contribute!<\/h4>\n<p>We&#8217;d love to hear your feedback as to how we could improve the Customizer Export\/Import plugin, or better yet, see theme developers actively contribute!

We have built a really simple-to-use Gutenberg block to add your existing FooGallery image galleries in seconds. And it includes live previews of the image gallery too!<\/p>\n<p><strong>GDPR<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you install FooGallery for the first time, the plugin asks you (the website admin) to opt-in so that we can track your usage of the plugin and provide a better service (send you update emails for new version releases and security updates etc). <em>This is optional and not required in order to use the plugin.<\/em><\/p>\n<p>From your website point of view, FooGallery never collects or stores any visitor information at all, when someone visits your website.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PHP 7 Compatible<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>FooGallery has been tried and tested on servers running up to PHP 7.4<\/p>\n<p><strong>Retina Support<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>FooGallery now comes with built-in support for higher quality thumbnails on retina-enabled displays. No more blurry thumbnails, just crisp thumbnails so that your image galleries look amazing on all devices.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Video Support<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>FooGallery PRO now supports the creation of video galleries! Import from YouTube, Vimeo, Facebook, TED and Dailymotion, or use a self-hosted video from any online source. You can also easily create mixed galleries with both images and videos!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Albums Built In<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Albums are built in as an extension. Simply head over to the extensions page and activate the albums extension. A new menu item will appear that allows you to add albums just as easily as galleries.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Built For Developers<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>FooGallery was designed to be the most developer-friendly image gallery plugin available for WordPress. It was also built on top of a solid extension framework, which means different functionality is separated out into different areas in the codebase. It also means the core plugin is lightweight, but still allowing for the most flexibility.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Special Thanks<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Thanks to Fortinet FortiGuard Labs for the security testing conducted on the plugin. FooGallery is a safer plugin thanks to them.<\/p>\n","short_description":"FooGallery is a powerful, responsive photo gallery plugin.

However, there&#8217;s a workaround: simply do a \u201cDatabase Only\u201d backup (use \u201cAdvanced Settings\u201d), transfer the wp-content directory over with FTP, and then restore new site. Then backup and migration also works. <\/li>\n<li>1% of cases: Your site\/hosting is abnormal (pardon our French) and backup or migration doesn&#8217;t work. However: that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll now be working on, so that eventually backups and migrations will work in all cases. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The 1% case means:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Basic rule: DO NOT use it as your only backup solution! Only use it for migrations (so that if something fails, you still have the files on your old site as backup). <\/li>\n<li>If you want to use it as backup, test it by restoring the backup file on a new site. If that works fine you should be safe.<\/li>\n<li>In any case, we cannot take any responsibility if backup or migration fails. <\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Note:<br \/>\n* There is never an issue in damaging the source installation (i.e. on the site where you create the backup). So backup sites at your pleasure. If your backup succeeds then chances are good that the migration (i.e. restore on another site) will also succeed. But don&#8217;t take any chances.<br \/>\n* If backup or migration (restore) fails, just try it again. Often it works on second attempt.<\/p>\n<h4>Other tips how to backup and migrate<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>NEVER overwrite an installation for which you do not have an alternate backup source (e.g. a cPanel backup). Normally you would restore the backup onto a fresh WP installation on another host or on a subdomain. If the restore fails your destination site might become unusable, so be prepared to enter cPanel and then destroy \/ recreate the new installation if necessary.<\/li>\n<li>DO NOT use our backup plugin on WP Engine or any hosting system with proprietary operating system. Instead, use their built-in backup tools.<\/li>\n<li>Large sites (&gt;2GB) might take as long as an hour to backup and migrate. Sites of 250 MB or less should take no more than a minute or two to backup, depending on your server.<\/li>\n<li>We recommend you deactivate and delete page caching, security and maybe redirection plugins before you migrate, and re-install them on the new site, if necessary. In general, delete all unnecessary plugins and data from your site before you backup. You can also use the &#8220;Exclude directories&#8221; option if you have large media files, which you can then copy back to the new site with FTP. <\/li>\n<li>How to copy from local server to your hosted website: Create a backup of the local site in the usual way, then save the backup file (right-click &gt; Save) to your local disk. Upload this file to the root directory of your destination website and then use this url in the \u201cRestore\u201d dialog of the new site: http:\/\/yourdomain.com\/.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Help Video<\/h4>\n<p>(Old video, but may still be helpful; we\u2019ll replace it with an updated one soon)<\/p>\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe class='youtube-player' width='640' height='360' src='https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/xN5Ffhyn4Ao?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent' allowfullscreen='true' style='border:0;'><\/iframe><\/span>\n<h4>Credits<\/h4>\n<p>WP Backup uses functions from the &#8220;Safe Search and Replace on Database with Serialized Data&#8221; script first written by David Coveney of Interconnect IT Ltd (UK) http:\/\/www.davidcoveney.com or http:\/\/www.interconnectit.com and released under the WTFPL http:\/\/sam.zoy.org\/wtfpl\/.

This allows passwords to be cracked with relative ease via brute force attack.<\/p>\n<p>WP Cerber blocks intruders by IP or subnet from making further attempts after a specified limit on retries is reached, making brute force attacks or distributed brute force attacks from botnets impossible.<\/p>\n<p>You will be able to create a <strong>Black IP Access List<\/strong> or <strong>White IP Access List<\/strong> to block or allow logins from a particular IP address, IP address range or a subnet any class (A,B,C).<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, you can create your Custom login page and forget about automatic attacks to the default wp-login.php, which takes your attention and consumes a lot of server resources. If an attacker tries to access wp-login.php they will be blocked and get a 404 Error response.<\/p>\n<h4>Malware scanner<\/h4>\n<p>Cerber Security Scanner is a sophisticated and extremely powerful tool that thoroughly scans every folder and inspects every file on a website for traces of malware, trojans, backdoors, changed and new files.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wpcerber.com\/wordpress-security-scanner\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more about the malware scanner<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Integrity checker<\/h4>\n<p>The scanner checks if all WordPress folders and files match what exist in the official WordPress core repository, compares your plugins and themes with what are in the official WordPress repository and alerts you to any changes. As with scanning free plugins and themes, the scanner scans and verifies commercial plugins and themes that are installed manually.<\/p>\n<h4>Scheduled Scans With Automatic File Recovery<\/h4>\n<p>Cerber Security Scanner allows you to configure a schedule for automated recurring scanning easily. Once the schedule is configured the scanner automatically scans the website, deletes malware and recovers modified and infected WordPress files. After every scan, you can get an optional email report with the results of the scan.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/wpcerber.com\/automated-recurring-malware-scans\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Read more about the scheduled scans<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h4>Two-Factor Authentication<\/h4>\n<p>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) provides an additional layer of security requiring a second factor of identification beyond just a username and password. When 2FA is enabled on a website, it requires a user to provide an additional verification code when signing into the website. This verification code is generated automatically and sent to the user by email.<\/p>\n<h4>Log, filter out and export activities<\/h4>\n<p>WP Cerber tracks time, IP addresses and usernames for successful and failed login attempts, logins, logouts, password changes, blocked IP and actions taken by itself. You can export them to a CSV file.<\/p>\n<h4>Limit login attempts reinvented<\/h4>\n<p>You can <strong>hide WordPress dashboard<\/strong> (\/wp-admin\/) when a user isn&#8217;t logged in. If a user isn&#8217;t logged in and they attempt to access the dashboard by requesting \/wp-admin\/, WP Cerber will return a 404 Error.<\/p>\n<p>Massive botnet brute force attack? That&#8217;s no longer a problem. <strong>Citadel mode<\/strong> will automatically be activated for awhile and prevent your site from making further attempts to log in with any username.<\/p>\n<h4>Cerber anti-spam engine<\/h4>\n<p>Anti-spam and anti-bot protection for contact, registration, comments and other forms.<br \/>\nWP Cerber anti-spam and bot detection engine now protects all forms on a website. No reCAPTCHA is needed.<br \/>\nIt\u2019s compatible with virtually any form you have. Tested with Caldera Forms, Gravity Forms, Contact Form 7, Ninja Forms, Formidable Forms, Fast Secure Contact Form, Contact Form by WPForms.<\/p>\n<h4>Anti-spam protection: invisible reCAPTCHA for WooCommerce<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WooCommerce login form<\/li>\n<li>WooCommerce register form<\/li>\n<li>WooCommerce lost password form<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Anti-spam protection: invisible reCAPTCHA for WordPress<\/h4>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress login form<\/li>\n<li>WordPress register form<\/li>\n<li>WordPress lost password form<\/li>\n<li>WordPress comment form<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>Integration with Cloudflare<\/h4>\n<p>A <a href=\"https:\/\/wpcerber.com\/cloudflare-add-on-wp-cerber\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">special Cloudflare add-on for WP Cerber<\/a> keeps in sync the list of blocked IP addresses with Cloudflare IP Access Rules.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Stay in compliance with GDPR<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>How to get full control of personal data to be in compliance with data privacy laws such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wpcerber.com\/export-personal-data\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Personal data export feature<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wpcerber.com\/delete-personal-data\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Personal data erase feature<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/wpcerber.com\/browser-cookies-set-by-wp-cerber\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">How WP Cerber processes browser cookies<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>Documentation &amp;

More information and tutorial available on the <a href=\"https:\/\/meowapps.com\/plugin\/wp-retina-2x\/\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">official website<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h3>Retina Methods<\/h3>\n<p>It supports different methods to serve the images to your visitors. Why? Depending on the theme and plugins you are using (and also the way you use images in your website), not all the methods can work. Ideally, I would recommend using the Responsive Images method, then if it doesn&#8217;t work, the PictureFill method (which covers normally most cases). Retina.js should be the fallback method. There are more methods than this with their specific options.<\/p>\n<h3>Plug &amp; Play<\/h3>\n<p>With a well-made theme and website, this plugin doesn&#8217;t require normally any specific set-up. All the defaults settings are fine. Works with multi-site and many kinds of installs.<\/p>\n<h3>Responsive Images<\/h3>\n<p>WP has support for Responsive Images and this plugin handles this nicely by adding the retina images in the src-set created by WordPress. The HTML for the images not handled by WP 4.4 (outside posts) will also be handled by the plugin (pick &#8220;Picturefill&#8221; method for this). The plugin also provides an option to disable the &#8216;Medium Large&#8217; created by WordPress which is actually not useful (it&#8217;s a hack basically), this plugin does it better.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimized<\/h3>\n<p>The plugin is very fast and optimized. It doesn&#8217;t create anything in the database.<\/p>\n<h3>Pro Version<\/h3>\n<p>The Pro version adds support for Retina for full-size, support for lazy-loading for your responsive images and various options. And it supports my work \ud83d\ude42<\/p>\n<h3>CSS &amp; Background Images<\/h3>\n<p>The plugin cannot inject CSS to handles the images added through CSS, that&#8217;s both too dangerous and potentially very incorrect. However, in its Pro version and with PictureFill, you get an option to replace the inline CSS background image by their retina equivalent.<\/p>\n<h4>Quickstart<\/h4>\n<ol>\n<li>Set your option (for instance, you probably don&#8217;t need retina images for every sizes set-up in your WP).<\/li>\n<li>Generate the retina images (required only the first time, then images are generated automatically).<\/li>\n<li>Check if it works! &#8211; if it doesn&#8217;t, read the FAQ, the tutorial, and check the forums.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n","short_description":"Make your website look beautiful and crisp on modern displays by creating and displaying retina images.
